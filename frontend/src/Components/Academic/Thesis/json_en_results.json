Based on 73 responses, cybersecurity knowledge and skill would become essential for PFSOs than ever before because the port digitalization and automation would shape the PFSOs career to a technically- oriented specialist rather than a multi-skilled generalist. Furthermore, the responsibilities of PFSOs would extend to cover cyber risk management, which enables them to prevent the digital port facilities from emerging cyber threats. Therefore, they should learn how to incorporate the existing risk management process with cyber risk management and cybersecurity knowledge because these would be the foundation for PFSOs to practice cybersecurity skills. At the end of the learning process, PFSOs could also gain cyber security competence once they have mature knowledge and skill, which would be the vital element of port security hygiene."

The products of which expected volumes are predicted include iron ore, oil, grain, cement, sand, coal, other ores, miscellaneous goods, and containers. We further distribute the forecasted value of each item among the different North Korean ports based on inputs obtained during expert interviews. The lected ports are the nine trading ports of North Korea, namely, Najin, Chongjin, Nampo, Rajin-Seonbong, Songnim, Haeju, Hungnam, Wonsan, and Dancheon. Herein, the authors assume and predict the complete economic reopening of North Korea. Based on the forecast outcomes, Nampo Port handles the largest cargo volume among North Korean ports, which is expected to amount to 113,217 thousand tons by 2050. Chongjin Port is revealed as the second largest in terms of throughput, and is predicted to handle 47,525 thousand tons of cargo by 2050. On the same terms, Najin Port is deemed the third largest and is predicted to handle 37,816 thousand tons of cargo by 2050. Containers (72,454 thousand tons) and cement (45,897 thousand tons) rank first and second among the items of which the largest volumes are expected to be handled by North Korean ports, by 2050. These findings provide insight into North Korean port ment potential and indicate prospects for inter-Korean cooperation, following North Korea’s economic reopening."

Specifically, the Southern Region dominates seaport-based container transportation, contributing 55% of Vietnam’s total vessel calls and 74% of its total container cargo volume, with the North and Central regions trailing far behind. However, despite the sector’s importance, the efficiency of container terminals in Southern Vietnam has not been evaluated by the literature in recent years. This study fills this research gap by using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to evaluate the efficiency of major container terminals in Southern Vietnam. The results of the DEA Malmquist analysis show that most container terminals demonstrated productivity growth be tween 2017 and 2019, and that this mainly derived from advancements in catch-up operational efficiency and in technological innovation. Moreover, the DEA slack-based measure and DEA undesirable output analyses demonstrate that three container terminals (Cai Mep International Terminal, Tan Cang Cat Lai, and Tan Cang–Cai Mep International Terminal) achieved the maximum efficiency level when both applying and not applying the undesirable output variable. However, other container terminals displayed severe erational inefficiency, with these terminals’ efficiency values decreasing by between 9% and 40% when considering undesirable outputs. The ineffective terminals can therefore be categorized as consuming cessive inputs and lacking in the production of desirable outputs or creating large amounts of undesirable outputs. Therefore, using these results, port authorities and policymakers should be better placed to velop appropriate strategies for managing container terminals in Southern Vietnam."

This paper aims at developing a conceptual framework to evaluate the role of dry ports from multi-criteria and multi-stakeholder approaches. Based on an extensive literature review, a hierarchy of evaluation criteria was developed from the perspectives of three main stakeholder groups, i.e. dry port users, seaport-based players and community. Interviews were then carried out to verify the face validity of the initially proposed framework given the context of Vietnam, followed by a survey assessing the dry port’s contributions. The findings highlight the major role of dry port users in driving the success of a dry port, while also recognizes significant roles of seaport-based players and the community. The study provides insights into how different stakeholder groups might value the contribution of dry ports and demonstrates that dry port characteristics have apparent impacts on their role as perceived by each group.

Many areas in the eastern part of Indonesia have a flawed logistics system that results in a low level of competitiveness.\nThe paper analyses local ports’ performance and maritime logistics impact on the small island economy in East Indonesia, especially in the North Maluku Province. The research method used the survey and the Stochastic Frontier Analysis to measure each local port’s performance in which Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) per capita constitutes the output variable.

The results show that the loading and unloading tariffs and sea transportation costs harm the GRDP per capita of the respective small island districts. Other findings suggest that the port of Morotai, Central Halmahera, North Halmahera, and Ternate have a higher level of technical efficiency than those in East Halmahera, South Halmahera, Sula, and Tidore. Low port efficiency can disrupt the distribution of goods between islands, resulting in higher logistics costs. The limited data and the small scope of the area is the restriction of the study."

A total of 265 questionnaires were analysed to verify therelevance of individual hypothesis in the research model through confirmatory factor analysis and struc-tural equation model analysis using AMOS 18.0. The results of five hypotheses testing demonstrated apositive and significant effect except that Hypothesis 4 on ‘job satisfaction will have a significant effecton organisational commitment’ was rejected. Overall, this paper provides important insights into the sig-nificance of CSR in global freight forwarding companies with theoretical development and the empiricaltest of CSR model, highlighting the trust to increase the organisational commitment of employees."

Indian container ports are very critical due to their location advantage and their ability to handle transhipment traffic. There is a need to understand their performance at the micro-level, specifically the terminal level rather than that of the whole port.\nThis paper focuses on the analysis of the technical efficiency of 26 container terminals in India using a data envelopment analysis approach for the years 2015–2018 and interprets it with respect to location advantage, administrative control and private control of terminal operations. The research explores the Malmquist index which measures productivity changes over a period of time and deconstructs them into two components, namely efficiency change, referred to as catch-up, and frontier shift. This study enabled the ranking of these terminals in terms of their performances. The relative efficiency of container terminals on the west coast of India is found to be better than that of the east coast of India, and the efficiency of container terminals operating under major ports is on a declining path when compared with that of minor ports. The private participation has also not seen similar productivity changes across all container terminals. Among the seven high performing container terminals identified through the analysis provided, the terminal at Tuticorin emerged as the most consistent one in terms of relative efficiency and growth in total factor productivity. The dominant factor influencing the efficiency of a terminal is found to be the size of the terminal, offering the advantages of economies of scale."

One of the reasons why the number of officers working on merchant ships is because of the working conditions onboard the ship. For instance, there are work-life balance, contractual employment, high workload and stress levels, insufficient shore leave, and career progression, and so on. Therefore, some public system is required for the seafarers to prepare for a stable life after they leave a ship while working on the ship to relieve anxiety. Among the many ways, the seafarefs retirement pension system is a practical and effective way to ensure a stable life for seafarers. The retirement pension system can be applied differently depending on the characteristics of the employees and companies that are subscribers, and their effects can also be different. So, in this study, we are intended to analyze what type of retirement pension seafarers prefer in Korea. Retirement pension is generally classified into defined benefit (DB), defined contribution (DC) and individual retirement pension (IRP). To survey the seafarers* preference on retirement pension by type, six hypotheses were established using company variables and seafarer variables. Company variables include the type of business and the number of seafarers employed by shipping company while seafarer variables include the service term, age, type of duty (ship's officer, sailor), and annual wage of the seafarer. To verify the established hypotheses, the survey of the seafarers who are currently employed by the shipping company was carried out. A cross-tabulation analysis among the statistical analysis approaches was performed and the chi-squared statistic was calculated to validate the hypotheses. Consequently, the preference varied depending on the service term and age of the seafarers. That is, the shorter the service term and the younger, individual retirement pension which allows personal asset management was preferred while those who have longer service term and older-age tended to prefer defined benefit. The outcome of this study is expected to be useful for the shipping company to design the retirement pension system for seafarers. Ultimately, the introduction of a seafarer retirement pension system will contribute to the influx of skilled crews, the competitiveness of the shipping company, and reduced marine accidents."

Through the framework, it fosters the industrial practitioners to implement cruise port strategies, cruise lines strategies and local government planning for the cruise destinations."

We perform the standard shift-share analysis and spatial shift-share analysis for the period 2010–2018 and investigate the import performance of Gwangyang Port for coal, iron ore, natural gas and vegetable matter. The static analysis shows thatthe regional shift effect, which is the mostimportant component, is negative for coal and iron ore, but positive for natural gas and vegetable matter. The spatial shift-share analysis also indicates that Gwangyang Port experiences not only the gains in regional competitiveness but the industrial advantage for iron ore, natural gas and vegetable matter owing to its higher competitiveness. Incorporating location coefficients into BCG matrix for coal imports, we also show that Gwangyang Port succeeds upgrading its position for natural gas and vegetable matter, but fails escaping from transformation category or upgrading its position for coal and iron ore."

Finally, the multivariate analysis is subsequently employed to ana lyze data obtained from surveys by structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Findings indicate that port logistics service quality is positively determined by five factors including responsiveness, assurance, reliability, tangibles and empathy. In addition, port logistics service quality exerts positive influence on customer satisfaction. Most noticeably, as embedded in the tangibles component, technological advance ments appear to enhance service quality which ultimately satisfies customers in the port logistics service industry."

The main benefit of consolidation is assumed to be economies of scale due to the aggregation of container cargo in one port, while that of privatization is cost reduction for port management and operations. We employ a multi-agent simulation model to express interactions among stakeholders, such as a port management body, shipping company, and shipper. The model is applied to a case study for the Kobe and Osaka ports in Japan. We find that consolidation has a larger impact than privatization in terms of cargo volume and total surplus. In particular, if future container cargo increases, consolidation accelerates the increase in cargo volume of the Kobe and Osaka ports. Transshipment cargo receives the largest volume in the case of “consolidation and privatization” when future container demand is increasing. However, the Busan port in South Korea, competitor of the Kobe and Osaka ports for transshipment cargo, would remain dominant even after the consolidation and privatization of the Kobe and Osaka ports, since its vessel frequency would be high in all cases."

Unsurprisingly, huge pressure has been placed on Chinese airports by the increasing demand for air transportation. Hence, it is meaningful to analyze the efficiency of Chinese airports as well as to determine which factors are most vital to improve airport efficiency.\nTo do so, a widely used methodology, the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is used for measuring efficiency in multiple areas, has been adopted. By means of the DEA method, the efficiency of 27 Chinese airports during the period from 2014 to 2018 was identified. Nine variables, including six input and three output variables, have been identified. Notably, the integration of the fuzzy MCDM method and the DEA approach proved to be optimal for developing a solid and reliable analysis. Therefore, an integrated CFPR/DEA-Window-AR model was developed to evaluate the airport efficiency of Chinese airports. In addition, a comparison of efficiency levels with and without defined criteria weights was conducted. The results proved that considering weights using the CFPR approach is both practical and reliable."

As the result, scenario III generates the lowest total shipping costs. In other words, involving the port of Tenau Kupang as a transhipment port can help to reduce total shipping costs. Finally, the selected scenario become a recommendation for shipping practices to find the best solutions to improve the eastern connectivity in Indonesia.

The data was collected from international freight forwarders. To achieve the objectives of this study, various analytical methods were used.

The results of structural equation modeling (SEM), moderated regression analysis (MRA), cluster analysis, analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc analysis are the basis of testing the hypotheses.

This means that international freight forwarders improve performance through strategic application of IS. Second, there is the interaction effect between internal and external IS on financial performance. This means that strategic application of internal and external IS is connected with financial performance.

The advantages of environmental management are not only for customer satisfaction and corporate image but also for cost saving and environment protection. The paper reviewed the development of green port in Thailand and used case study of Laem Chabang port (LCP) to figure out the green port assessment criteria and to set up the Environmental Performance Indicators. The paper conducted entropy approach to analysis environmental performance indicators (EPIs) of LCP based on secondary data from 2011 to 2014. Main findings of this paper indicate the top 5 rank EPIs including TKN in wastewater, Chromium in soil and sediment, TSP in the air, Phytoplankton biodiversity, and Zooplankton biodiversity respectively."

The present paper investigates how the LCCs, as compared to car ferry services, secure the competitive advantage in the international transportation service as compared to car ferry services. We have focused on the factors shippers regard as the most important for selecting transportation mode. For a reasonable comparison, we have limited the business area to the north eastern Asian countries, including Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. We have developed a questionnaire for the shippers who export their own product in these countries from Korea.

In the literature, the challenges of increasing reliability, space utilisation, and reducing waste have been managed through improved warehousing processes and technology; however, the important role of employees through responsibility shift in enhancing warehousing performance has not yet been fully explored. This study therefore examines the relationship between the employment of Responsibility Shift (RS) and Warehousing Performance (WP) in Australia within the processes of Inbounding and Storage through the usage of a survey conducted with department supervisors and managers of warehousing companies which were members of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport in Australia (CILTA) and Supply Chain and Logistics Association of Australia (SCLAA). It was found that RS positively causes a statistically significant influence on warehousing performance. This research contributes to enrich the literature on RS as it is perhaps the first study which examines the effects of RS on warehousing performance in Australia while also enables warehousing managers to explore ways to improve warehousing performance from the human resource management perspective. Although being significant both in terms of managerial and academic implications, the generalizability of this research is limited from a small sample size. Future research, therefore, needs to look into a wider population as well as further investigation into the effects of Responsibility Shift in the rapidly developing warehousing business environment elsewhere in the world."

When EPU increases, companies may achieve higher growth and subsequent leverage resulting from opportunities in uncertainty. Contrary to previous literature, the GDPs of Thailand and China exert a smaller influence on leverage than EPU. Further, interest spread in Thailand, though directly affecting the cost of borrowing, has a positive association with leverage decisions. Shipping SMEs may use the spread when deciding to take on greater risk and exploit growth opportunity. Through deeper analysis, we find that the leverage decisions of dry bulk companies are more sensitive to Chinese and Thai macroeconomic factors than those of tanker firms. Our findings call for policymakers to support the increasing bilateral trading, shipping, and financing between Thailand and China."

These higher costs are also reflective of the country’s inefficient logistics system, which can be confirmed by the fact that Vietnam's Logistics Index (LPI) fell from 48 in 2014 to 64 in 2016. Therefore, Vietnam is in urgent need of improving its national logistics in system.

This study aims to establish empirical data on navigation practices on Kenyir Lake, Malaysia which is the largest artificial lake in South East Asia that was created primarily for power generation in 1985. Its natural and human-made features result in a multi-use lake involving navigation. The objective of this study is to determine who the users are, the type of vessels used, and the availability of navigational aids and the economic contribution of Kenyir Lake. The research approach was based on a combination of exploratory and descriptive methods utilising observations, interviews and surveys. The study identified and categorised the users into five different criteria, namely 1) government, 2) business, 3) tourism, 4) personal and 5) others that were engaged with navigation on the lake using speedboats and houseboats. Using an Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method, the pair-wise comparison matrix of all navigation users was analysed and ranking tourism as the highest activity. Furthermore, it was further observed that navigation on the lake does not conform to international standards and conventions as practised elsewhere in Malaysia. It is anticipated that the local authorities will benefit from this empirical study to further enhance navigation safety practices and efficiency in managing all water activities and users at Kenyir Lake, Malaysia."

According to the World Bank Logistic Performance Index (LPI) 2016, Malaysia was ranked number 32 out of 160 countries in 2016, as against number 25 in 2014, despite a high level of warehouse activity during that year. The decrease in ranking was due to low warehouse productivity in Malaysia. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to consider ten parameters to assess the failure factors of warehouse productivity in the Malaysian logistics service sector, by applying a fuzzy analytic hierarchy process method. The findings highlighted the top three failure factors that influence the levels of warehouse productivity in the Malaysian logistics service sector as being ‗labour productivity‘, ‗warehouse utilisation‘ and ‗inventory space utilisation‘. This study contributes to the empowerment of warehouse productivity in the industry, in alignment with Malaysia‘s aspirational 2020 economic target. Consequently, this study provides new knowledge on warehouse productivity issues that will benefit decision makers in the warehouse industry. This research may enable decision makers to recognise problematic factors when planning their warehouse productivity improvement strategy, which may contribute to fulfilling government targets and empowering the national economy."

This study develops a model for integrating services among more than two courier companies for the same service area by proposing a way to design and assign routes for luggage delivery to each participating company. We verify the results of the proposed integration and cooperative operation model by comparing performance indicators (including total cost) between two routing approaches, the dynamic and fixed models, based on the demand pattern.

According to the court judgments in the two cases, if the accident occurs during the shipment without issuance of Bill of Lading (B/L), the reverse-side clause of B/L does not apply to the calculation of damage, and the law of the country most closely related to both parties is set as the governing law. The absence of a timely B/L often occurs in transport practice due to the complicated nature of transport practice. So, through analyzing the court judgments in the two cases, this study recommends that transport parties take precautions. First, in order to reduce and settle disputes arising from the absence of evidence of transportation contracts, it is necessary to issue a received B/L bearing in mind the risk of accidents occurring during the shipment process. Second, the use of a Sea Waybill (SWB) which can be issued after the receipt of a cargo shipment, can be an alternative, except when a Letter of Credit (L/C) requires a B/L. Finally, expanding the function of the Commercial Invoice (C/I) to allow it to serve as evidence of the contract of carriage by inserting the contract of carriage phrase into the C/I when the B/L is not issued could be an alternative."

Validity and reliability of measuring items were verified by a confirmatory factor analysis, and the causal links among the variables were verified by a structural equation modeling analysis. The results are as follows. First, the relationship between perceived environmental uncertainty and supply chain integration is the causal link. Environmental uncertainty is an antecedent of supply chain integration and this is explained by information processing theory. Second, supply chain integration has a positive effect on operational performance. To improve performance, managers have need of interaction with suppliers and customers as well as inter-departments. Third, there is no direct effect between environment and performance but there are direct, indirect and total effects among the variables.

It reveals the impacts of port network centrality on port competitiveness. The results of analysis firstly indicate that the degree centrality in the throughput flow is changing from the Busan port in Korea to the Shanghai or Qingdao port in China. Second, the export volume of Korea is decreasing, whereas the trade volume of China is increasing. Third, as for the major ports in Korea and China, China may be in a favorable position compared to Korea owing to the increase in the number of service routes, fleets, and service liner shipping companies. Hence, the centrality of the Chinese port has been increasing because the liners intentionally design their service routes with focus on Shanghai port.

The primary objectives of this paper were to study the focal economy points of feeder services in Malaysia and to demonstrate the type of network patterns practised by Malaysian feeder service providers.

Moreover, to demonstrate the network patterns of each feeder service provider, a route network model was designed. The main finding from this study found that Port Klang was the primary feeder hub port and focal economy point in Malaysia due to the highest number of feeder vessels entering the port. Furthermore, the type of route patterns applied by Malaysian feeder service providers were determined and categorised based on three models: 75 % (basic model), 17.5 % (butterfly model), and 7.5 % (chain model) collected data consisting of 40 service routes.

To achieve the objective, this research collects and analyzes 219 data responded by the members of the Korea International Trade Association. Reliability and validity of the data are tested by an exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis. The relationships between the variables are tested by an analysis of structural equation modeling. The results are as follows. First, environmental capabilities of Korean exporters have a positive effect on environmental strategy. Capabilities of the firms as an internal resource are based on performing strategy. Firms which have superior environmental capabilities can be possible to make an effort on cooperative environmental improvement among departments and this is based on environmental collaboration with customers and suppliers. Second, external environmental strategy of Korean exporters has a positive effect on environmental performance.

To achieve the objective, this research collects and analyzes 219 data responded by the members of the Korea International Trade Association. Reliability and validity of the data are tested by an exploratory factor analysis and a confirmatory factor analysis. The relationships between the variables are tested by an analysis of structural equation modeling. The results are as follows. First, environmental capabilities of Korean exporters have a positive effect on environmental strategy. Capabilities of the firms as an internal resource are based on performing strategy. Firms which have superior environmental capabilities can be possible to make an effort on cooperative environmental improvement among departments and this is based on environmental collaboration with customers and suppliers. Second, external environmental strategy of Korean exporters has a positive effect on environmental performance. Environmental collaboration with customers and suppliers is based on attaining superior environmental performance. Third, environmental capabilities of Korean exporters have a positive effect on environmental performance. Environmental capabilities as a strategic resource of the firms are based on achieving a high level of environmental performance, and the firms can attain a sustainable competitive advantage in the market.

Such a deterministic assumption, however, never holds true in real life. The purpose of this paper is to examine how collaboration between berth terminals could affect the port performance when dealing with uncertainty. Given the complexity of the problem, we have used discrete event simulation to model the system. Two major scenarios were evaluated, namely non-collaborative-response and collaborative-response. Collaborative-response is implemented by sharing resources such as berth, quay cranes and container yard among two terminals. The port performance was evaluated based on ship waiting time, container handling time and total ship turnaround time.

Managing the time factor has become a crucial issue in today’s liner shipping operations. A statistic in 2015 showed that the overall punctuality for containerships only reached an on-time performance of 73%. However, vessel punctuality is affected by many factors such as the port and vessel conditions and knock-on effects of delays. As a result, this paper develops a model for analyzing and predicting the arrival punctuality of a liner vessel at ports of call under uncertain environments by using a hybrid decision-making technique, the Fuzzy Rule-Based Bayesian Network (FRBBN). In order to ensure the practicability of the model, two container vessels have been tested by using the proposed model. The results have shown that the differences between prediction values and real arrival times are only 4.2% and 6.6%, which can be considered as reasonable.

The collected monthly data for 12 years was obtained from the China seaborne container trade (CSCT) and the China Containerized Freight Index (CCFI). Containership fleet development and the prices of new and second-hand container ships were classified based on five container vessel sizes (January of 2004–December of 2015). The period of simulation for this study was from 2004 to 2020. To analyze the optimal timing for the container ship orders, container ship fleet development as a supply factor and the CSCT as a demand factor, both of which are components of CCFI, were simulated. After the first simulation, CCFI was simulated holistically. Based on the CCFI simulation results, it was possible to develop three optimal timing scenarios for ship order placement. The CCFI for October 2016 was in the initial entry status of a short-term rebound, which makes it possible for shipping companies to order ships without the risk of revenue loss. The second best time period is May 2018, before the CCFI recovery of May 2019. The third best time for ship orders is later in 2020 for a CCFI recovery after 2021."

However, shipping and logistics industry of Korea has suffered from default risk since Global Financial Crisis in 2008. This study examines the relationship between the default risk, as measured by the Altman K-Score, and firm value, as measured by the Return on Assets (ROA), of shipping and logistics firms in Korea and compares the impact of default risk on firm value between good financial health firms and poor financial health firms. As the trends of K-Scores over a ten-year periods, shipping and logistics firms in Korea register weak-to-moderate financial healthy rage. We find that Altman K-Score is significantly linked with firm value and also higher performing firms as measured by the ROA exhibit higher financial health as measured by K-Score. Although nine years have been passed since Global Financial Crisis 2008, Korean shipping and logistics industry is still under the financial depression. This study proposes that systematic financial alert system of Korean shipping and logistics industry should be required to decrease default risk reflecting significance of Korean economy."

This study aims to fill the gap in research on the competitive strategic position and analysis of Southeast Asian container ports in order to allow seaport operators to visualize the position and progress of selected ports as well as to predict the future development possibilities of seaports. The findings revealed effective operations at the following ports that retained their dominant positions during the duration of the study: Port Klang, Tanjung Pelepas (Malaysia), Manila (the Philippines), Laem Chabang (Thailand), and Tan Cang Sai Gon (Vietnam).

Container market is no exception, and the quality of providing service in a container terminal is of prime importance in attracting new customers and maintaining the existing ones. The main aim of present research is to evaluate the quality of service being offered at Shahid Rajaee Container Terminal (SRCT) in Bandar Abbas port. The evaluation process uses SERVQUAL model which is an appropriate tool for measuring the service quality, identifying and analyzing available gaps between service expectations and perceptions. Target population in this research includes customers of SRCT. The standard and customized questionnaires were distributed among 165 samples, out of which 127 (77%) were returned. For the purpose of data analyses, initially the reliability of SERVQUAL model was checked, and then paired sample t-test was performed to reveal any possible gap between expectations and perceptions of respondents. Finally, TOPSIS was used to rank the 9 main container service companies in the SRCT. The results indicated that there are significant gaps between customers’ expectations and perceptions in SRCT, in all five dimensions of services quality. Additionally, from weighing point of view, ‘Tangibles’ was the most important dimension, followed by ‘Reliability’, ‘Assurance’, ‘Responsiveness’ and ‘Empathy’. In addition, ‘Tangibles’ dimension had maximum gap and ‘Empathy’ dimension had minimum gap between customers’ expectations and perceptions. Finally, after ranking companies, BandarAbbas Aria Container Terminal (BACT) Company was ranked first among nine companies in satisfying customers’ expectations."

The findings reveal that although Malaysia’s major container seaports are connected to the hinterlands through road and rail transport, they are highly dependent on road. These seaports are also connected to inland freight facilities such as dry ports and ICDs, which are positioned as transit points to help connect exporters and importers in the hinterlands to seaports as well as facilitating regional and cross-border trades.

The findings reveal that although Malaysia’s major container seaports are connected to the hinterlands through road and rail transport, they are highly dependent on road. These seaports are also connected to inland freight facilities such as dry ports and ICDs, which are positioned as transit points to help connect exporters and importers in the hinterlands to seaports as well as facilitating regional and cross-border trades. This paper suggests that the quality of hinterland connectivity of Malaysian container seaports could be improved by implementing strategies which tackle the existing challenges including overcoming an extremely imbalanced modal split, insufficient rail capacity and limited train services, increasing road congestion and the limitations of space restriction in some inland facilities."

These include unbalanced fleet proportions, which makes maximizing the shipping space available problematic; limited financial and managerial competences as well as outdated and inadequate infrastructure. The aim of this paper is to examine the Vietnam shipping industry and consider possible changes in policy led factors to facilitate the country’s full participation in the ASEAN integration."

Three factors that can influence ship safety were considered: economic factors, ship-handling and management factors, and government budget allocation of ship industry. SD was then applied to model the factors involved in ship accidents. Data on ship accidents in Korea from 2009–2014 were included in the model simulation. To measure the simulation accuracy, mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) analysis was employed. Following the simulation, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to determine the relationships among the factors involved in ship accidents. Finally, a simulation incorporating ship accident data and government budget allocated to the ship industry was performed.

This paper will expound the true motivations of the establishment and the privatization of KSC in 1950 and in 1968, respectively. KSC, as Korea’s national shipping company, sailed along a very unusual course of development. It was established in 1950 not to foster and develop Korea’s shipping industry but to help alleviate the financial burdens of the fledgling Korean government. The main cause of privatizing KSC in 1968 was a purely political decision, not an economic one as it overlapped with the rapid growth period of the shipping industry in the world, as well as in Korea. In sum, KSC, a state-run enterprise, was a bane in the short run but a boon in the long run for both the Korean government and Korea’s shipping industry. If we can believe KSC followed the ordinary sailing route as a state-run enterprise, we might develop a new opinion that the national shipping company might be a financial burden in a short period, but various benefits over a long period."

The multi-dimensional scaling cluster analysis by R-square method was used as the benchmarking tool to provide airport management with a means to examine various aspects of their operational efficiency against those of other airports. Ten operational efficiency factors for the clustering and efficiency estimation of airports in the Asia Pacific region were used in a regression model to overcome the complexity of multi-dimensional scaling approach. The resulting classification is used to identify the efficiency benchmarks of leading air cargo airports which have implications for Incheon airport in Korea."

Therefore, we can now explore new shipping routes through the Arctic Ocean instead of the existing commercial route. In particular, the Northern Sea Route (NSR) is one of the feasible shipping routes and, has provided tremendous shipping benefits. If the NSR becomes commercialized, we will be able to save about 5,000 nautical miles in distance and sailing time. In this study, we will emphasize some of the important results on the possibility of commercializing the shipping route in the Arctic. The NSR may bring positive economic effects in terms of shipping distance and time. For example, when utilizing the NSR, the maximum cargo traffic between Asia and Europe is expected to be around 46 million TEU. However, we also need to consider an expensive passage fee that is currently imposed by Russia. In conclusion, we maintain our efforts to protect the environment in the Arctic, in terms of logistics, and we need to explore every possible avenue to bring possible economic benefits to the North Pacific countries."

The aim of this paper is to discuss the seafarer shortage issue from the perspective of Vietnam which is one of the key emerging sources of crew supply in Asia. Specifically, a case study research involving the Vietnam Ocean Shipping Joint Stock Company (VOSCO) is used to highlight the challenges confronting the current recruitment and retention of seafarers in Vietnam. With regards to recruitment, it was found that the low quality of graduates and trained seafarers, as well as the lack of competent onshore crew executives are pertinent issues that need to be addressed by shipping industry employers in Vietnam. In terms of retention, poor working and living conditions on-board ships is a key factor that must be given attention to improve retention among seafarers.

The main objective of this paper is to weigh the most dominant decision-making criteria by Technique for Order Preference to Similarity by Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) and select an optimised container seaport in the Persian Gulf by Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) according to decisive port selection factors. This paper presents an extensive review of port selection decision-making attributes in different past studies. Finally, by using TOPSIS and AHP, the findings of this research suggest that the working time, stevedoring rate, safety, port entrance, sufficient draft, capacity of port facilities, operating cost, number of berths, ship chandelling, and international policies are critical factors for selecting container seaport in the Persian Gulf."

This study recognises the gap in the existing maritime literature and aimed to propose and validate a service quality (SQ) model to address such a gap. The study employs a triangulation approach, utilising literature review, interviews and surveys to develop, refine and verify the SQ model proposed. Interviews were conducted with various parties in the tramp sector while a survey using a sample size of 343 tramp shippers and 254 tramp service providers was also conducted with tramp shippers and tramp service providers. It was revealed that the SQ model of six dimensions of Corporate Image, Customer Focus, Management, Outcomes, Personnel and Technical, and their 18 associated attributes could be used as a reliable tool to measure service quality in tramp shipping. This research contributes to fill the gap in the existing literature by introducing and validating a new SQ model specifically for tramp shipping.

First, EU has a positive inuence on II but it has no effect on EI. Second, LIS has a positive inuence on LI, which means LIS can provide a useful foundation for LI in a port logistics process. Third, II has a positive inuence on EI. When port logistics firms have efficient internal processes, they can structure efficient relationships with customers and suppliers. Fourth, II has a positive inuence on CSP but EI does not lead directly to better outcomes of performance. In other words, EI is necessary but not a sufcient condition for an improvement of CSP.

In global logistics environment, stiff competition among major ports worldwide to dominate and control the container market will get more intense.Therefore, ports strive to improve the service and facilities to attract more ships from across the world. As of 2008, more than 80% of international trade is done by sea transport and to meet the growing demand for goods transport, ports need to expand their capacity by improving the productivity of ports facilities. In this regard, this study focuses on the evaluation and comparison of port efficiency with 4 productivity criteria based on which the overall ranking will be determined. For the research, we employed PROMETHEE method to calculate the rank of the 19 European container ports.\nThe result shows that the GioiaTauro, Valencia, and Rotterdam ports scored the rst 3 ranks in the year 2010, respectively. The Rotterdam has the highest productive working hours but lowest productivity in crane utilization.\nValencia has 2 criteria (berth, area) with the highest productivity but relatively longer working hours considering the throughput. GioiaTauro shows 69%or higher in 3 criteria(berth, area, crane) with the highest crane productivity,whereas the working hour is only 18% in productivity.

As per the technical specification of MH, it has 8~15 knots speed, 250TEU laden capacity, 4 meters draft, 92 meters LOA, 26 meters breadth, 30 moves handling rate capacity per hour. With this specification, the strong point of MH is to reduce port time of the mother ship by implementing a cross-docking handling system alongside the mother ship or feeder ship. Furthermore, due to the crane on board, the berthing place will be expanded, i.e. MH is able to approach general cargo handling berth without a dedicated quay crane. The paper concludes that MH may be used as a useful modal shift tool. The transit distance of 100 nautical miles is a decisive point to win the road mode regardless of the ship’s speed. If the distance is more than 100 nautical miles, mobile harbor has the competitive advantage in pulling cargo from road transportation mode. Even though the result of analysis shows a positive signal for modal shift, the real situation does not go that way. That means modal shift has several attributes applicable to the real world."

Data for the study were obtained from a questionnaire survey distributed to MNCs operating in FTPZs in Taiwan. The importance-performance analysis (IPA) technique was employed to analyse the survey results. Five factors were found to have a high degree of importance for business operations in FTPZs: government administration efficiency, cheap rates and charges, simplified customs procedures, clear regulations, and free tax incentives. Further, results indicated that firms in FTPZ had increased their performance in terms of reputation, investment, customer satisfaction, and revenue.

The fixed costs and capacity are shared by a predetermined ration of contributed containerships for the jointly-operated service route. The exchange rate of slot-exchange pattern depends on the relative ration of both round-voyage sailing days. Each contributing shipping company needs to estimate and account for the voyage fixed costs of each component serviced route in the agreement. This paper also simulates the effects that bunker cost and vessel hire changes have on shipping costs. The examination indicated the fixed costs are US$424 per TEU in 2010, with 63.1% attributable to bunker costs and 24.04% to containership costs. The validation shows the peak of charter hire in 2006, the fixed costs were estimated US$637 per TEU, with 63.92% attributable to containership costs and 27.53% attributable to bunker costs. (for ship of a capacity of 1,100 TEUs and 28 round-trip days). The results proof the proposed equations can represent cost and are helpful for container carriers to maintain market competition."

The fixed costs and capacity are shared by a predetermined ration of contributed containerships for the jointly-operated service route. The exchange rate of slot-exchange pattern depends on the relative ration of both round-voyage sailing days. Each contributing shipping company needs to estimate and account for the voyage fixed costs of each component serviced route in the agreement. This paper also simulates the effects that bunker cost and vessel hire changes have on shipping costs. The examination indicated the fixed costs are US$424 per TEU in 2010, with 63.1% attributable to bunker costs and 24.04% to containership costs. The validation shows the peak of charter hire in 2006, the fixed costs were estimated US$637 per TEU, with 63.92% attributable to containership costs and 27.53% attributable to bunker costs. (for ship of a capacity of 1,100 TEUs and 28 round-trip days). The results proof the proposed equations can represent cost and are helpful for container carriers to maintain market competition."

In this paper, the anticipated prospect of the competition between Chinese ports and neighboring countries’ major ports is to be suggested.\nFor the appraisal criteria on the prospect toward Premier Port status, four elements, which are composed of geographical advantages, scale of container volumes, cost advantage, and national port policy, were selected, and used. As the result of the assessment, the port of Shanghai was evaluated as holding the highest probability toward Premier Port rather than any other East Asian major ports. Finally, it was recommended that the neighboring countries major ports with China which are confronted with the challenge from the Chinese ports, would be better to transform their strategies from current competition and quantity oriented policy to cooperation and value oriented policy."
