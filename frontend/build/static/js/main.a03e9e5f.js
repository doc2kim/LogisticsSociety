the competitiveness of 14 major ports in Korea in view of international trade with China. Factor analysis (FA) revealed three common factors among 12 indicators representing port competitiveness. The three common factors were designated as \u201cport operation scale\\", \u201cport hinterland economy\\" and \u201cshipping conditions in terms of international trade with China.\\" Overall scores and ranks of each port were calculated based on FA.

Based on centrality, a core concept of social network analysis, it was analyzed in a total of four aspects of centrality: degree of connection, proximity, relationship, and Eigenvector. As a result of the analysis, it was found that Busan Port was in an overwhelming position in the degree of direct and indirect connection with ports on the Pacific route. In particular, it ranked high every year in the mediating centrality index indicating the port\'s bridge position, that is, its position as a transhipment port. However, European routes showed low centrality. In particular, it was found that it has a very weak network in proximity centrality considering the degree of indirect connection between ports.

Using 5,867 chartering data from 2018 to 2021 and applying network analysis and OLS, we found that shipping companies that are a member of shipping alliance or that are established in Europe tend to pay lower chartering rate than those who are not. This result implies companies from alliance or Europe could engage in a more favorable chartering contract with higher bargaining power. Also, after the outbreak of COVID-19, the charter rate per TEU increased, while the charter period was reduced. Although transportation demand temporarily decreased following the outbreak of COVID-19, it is estimated that the charter rate has increased as the container transportation market has become more active, as evidenced by the increase in freight rates and the continuous increase in transportation demand beginning in the second half of 2020."}]},"fpage":"579","lpage":"600","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002762265","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2021","pub-mon":"09","volume":"37","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002762261","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"CFPR\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uad6d\ub0b4 \uac74\uc124\uae30\uacc4 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc120\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study of Determinants on Logistics Companies of Domestic Construction Equipment Companies Using CFPR"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc724\uacbd(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\ubc15\uc131\ud6c8(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\uacbd\uc601\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)","\ucd5c\uc601\uc11c(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \uac74\uc124\uae30\uacc4 \uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uccb4\ub97c \uc120\uc815\ud560 \ub54c \uc911\uc694\uc2dc\ub418\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778 \ubc0f \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 CFPR(Consistent Fuzzy Prefernence Relations)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac74\uc124\uae30\uacc4 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc885\uc0ac\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub825 10\ub144 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c In-depth interview\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ucd5c\uc885 4\uac1c\uc758 \ub300\uc694\uc778\uacfc 16\uac1c\uc758 \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud588\ub2e4. \ub300\uc694\uc778\uacfc \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc778\uc744 \uacf1\ud55c \uc885\ud569\uac00\uc911\uce58\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c\ub294 \ud611\ub825\uad00\uacc4 \uc720\uc9c0 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131(0.082)\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uaca9 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825(0.076), \uacbd\ud5d8(0.074), \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc548\uc815\uc131(0.071) \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac74\uc124\uae30\uacc4 \uc5c5\uccb4\uac00 \ubb3c\ub958 \ud611\ub825\uc5c5\uccb4\ub97c \uc120\uc815\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ud611\ub825\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc120\uc815\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uac74\uc124\uae30\uacc4 \ucde8\uae09 \ubb3c\ub958 \uc5c5\uccb4\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc790\uccb4 \uc5ed\ub7c9 \uacc4\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\ucd08 \uc790\ub8cc\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study aims to compare and examine the important factors and weights for selecting a logistics company through analysis.

The trade volume affected on SCFI by 0.281123 before COVID-19, while affected on SCFI by 1.12893 after COVID-19 respectively. Meanwhile, container ship supply was analyzed to influence 1.12893 and 2.97813, before and after COVID-19 and it was shown that the effect of container ship supply on SCFI increased after COVID-19.

DEA-CCR model shows the comprehensive efficiency of Chinese container terminals(average 0.873) is slightly higher than that of Korean terminals(average 0.865). However, with regard to pure technical efficiency measured by DEA-BCC model the Korean container terminals(average 0.926) outweigh the Chinese terminals(average 0.888). Therefore, Korean container terminals should improve their scale efficiency and Chinese terminals should enhance their pure technical efficiency.

According to empirical findings, product risk and price orientation may cause increased rate of logistics cost volatility. However, the volatility can be decreased by product standardization and comprehensive terms of transportation contract.

The result of the study finds the way to create an efficient railroad logistics hub in Gangwon province and suggests the strategic implication to implement it."}]},"fpage":"421","lpage":"440","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002762245","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2021","pub-mon":"06","volume":"37","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002732481","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uc785\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\ud1b5\uad00\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c: \uae30\uc5c5, \ud654\ubb3c, \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc2ed, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Determinants of Using Electronic Customs Clearance System in Chinese Export-Import Companies: Focusing on Factors Relevant to Firm, Cargo, Partnership and System"}]},"author-group":{"author":["BAI Xue(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uacbd\uc0c1\ub300\ud559 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc)","\uc870\ud601\uc218(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc815\uc6b0(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uacbd\uc0c1\ub300\ud559 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc)","FAN Rong(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uacbd\uc0c1\ub300\ud559 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uc785\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\ud1b5\uad00\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5c5, \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc2ed, \ud654\ubb3c, \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc124\uc124\uc815 \ud6c4 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc778 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud558\uba74 \uae30\uc5c5\ud2b9\uc131 \uc911 \ubb34\uc5ed\ube44\uc911, \uc815\ubcf4\uae30\uc220\uc778\ub825, \uae30\uc5c5\uac00\uc815\uc2e0\uc774 \ud574\ub2f9\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\ud1b5\uad00\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud65c\uc6a9\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uad00\ub828\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc2ed \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ud654 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud654\ubb3c\ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5\uc131\uc774 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uc804\uc790\ud1b5\uad00\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\uc131, \uc720\uc6a9\uc131, \uc6a9\uc774\uc131\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \ud568\uaed8, \ubb34\uc5ed\ube44\uc911, \uc815\ubcf4\ud654, \uc720\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uc804\uc790\ud1b5\uad00\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud65c\uc6a9 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub294 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc808\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc774 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study is designed to analyze the use of electronic customs clearance system in China. We have set various determinants relevant to firm, cargo, partnership and system. In addition, we analyze moderating effects of support policy by the Chinese government. Based on theoretical foundations and previous studies, we made several hypotheses among variables. Empirical findings show that trade participation, IT human resources and entrepreneurship play an important role to enhance the use of electronic customs clearance system. Information connectivity between companies is also a critical determinant. Well-organized, usefulness and ease of use of the system have a positive effect on the adopting of the electronic customs clearance system.

Inefficiency at Busan port mainly caused by the dual operation with both New-port and North-port. Concentration of container function of Busan port into New-port is the only real solution to address this inefficiency issue with supply more additional capacity to the New-port. To date, however, the long-term container volume of New-port has considered that throughput exceeding handling capacity of North-port in total forecasted throughput in the port master plan. That is, the growth potential and competitiveness of New-port are not reflect in forecasting process and hence it is most likely to underestimate long-term throughput of New-port.\\nThis paper attempt to estimate the choice probability of Busan New-port from the perspective of shipping lines. Markov-chain is employed to estimate probability of future state and the data were collected through a survey of shipping lines calling Busan port. The result indicates that the choice probability is over 90% both every responded shipping lines and intra-Asia shipping companies who mainly calling North-port in target year. And the stationary market share of New-port indicates 100% because of there are no shipping lines to divert their calling port from New-port to North-port."}]},"fpage":"311","lpage":"324","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002732468","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2021","pub-mon":"06","volume":"37","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002732467","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\uc0ac\uc5c5\uc758 \ube44\uc2dc\uc7a5\uac00\uce58 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Non-market Valuation of Port Investment Project"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc0c1\uc724(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc885\ud544(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc2dc\uc124 \ud22c\uc790 \ubc0f \ub9ac\ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub358 \ube44\uc2dc\uc7a5\uac00\uce58 \ud3b8\uc775\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub178\ud6c4 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc2dc\uc124\uc758 \uac1c\ub7c9\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc \ub0b4 \ud63c\uc7a1\uc744 \ud574\uc18c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubd80\uac00 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ubd81\ud56d\uc758 \uc18c\ud615\uc120 \uc811\uc548\uc2dc\uc124 \uac1c\uc120\uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uc2dc\uc7a5\uac00\uce58\ub97c \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uac00\uce58\uce21\uc815\ubc95(CVM)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e8\uc77c\uacbd\uacc4 \ubc0f \uc774\uc911\uacbd\uacc4 \uc591\ubd84\uc120\ud0dd\ud615 \ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uace0\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub178\ud6c4\ud56d\ub9cc\uc2dc\uc124 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ube44\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud3b8\uc775\uc744 \uacbd\uad00\uac1c\uc120, \uc548\uc804\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uad00\uad11 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8 \ubc0f \ud734\uc2dd\uacf5\uac04 \uc81c\uacf5 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud615\ud654\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucd94\uc815\uacb0\uacfc \ube44\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud3b8\uc775\uc740 2019\ub144 \ubd88\ubcc0\uac00\uaca9 \uae30\uc900 \uc5f0\uac04 \uc57d 54\uc5b5 800\ub9cc \uc6d0\uc5d0 \ub2ec\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc870\uac74\ubd80 \uac00\uce58\uce21\uc815\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \ucd08\uae30\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c\uc11c \uc720\uc0ac \ud56d\ub9cc\uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ud6c4\uc18d\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc774 \uac80\uc99d\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uae30\ub97c \uae30\ub300\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to measure the overall scale of non-market value benefits, which have been evaluated very limitedly in port facility investment projects so far.

To this end, both Single-bounded Dichotomous Choice and Double-bounded Dichotomous Choice models were used to improve the rationality of the evaluation. Non-market benefits from the improvement of old port facilities were categorized into landscape improvement, safety improvement, tourism program and rest area provision. As a result of the estimation, the non-market benefit amounted to about 5.4 billion won per year based on the constant price in 2019.

What is significant in this argument is that the imbalance can reflect relative weight of the volumes across container ports and the degree centrality can be considered as an important indicator to identify the most influential ports in a network. The approach employed in this analysis was developed based on a mathematical model. We dealt here with Japanese major container ports.

As a result of AHP analysis, as the top strategic factors, the port hinterland and reinforcement of linkage are the most important, followed by port operation efficiency. Out of all 16 implementation tasks, the most important tasks to be pursued were the expansion of the port hinterland, the creation of a port cluster, and the development of smart ports in order. There was identified no difference in perception between groups through the T-test.

In addition, the items to be considered attracting preferentially at Gwangyang Port are plastics and their products, boilers and machinery and electrical equipment, that can be attracted about 110,000TEU.\\nIn order to attract the derived volume, it seems necessary to establish a target marketing strategy by securing a company list."}]},"fpage":"91","lpage":"112","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002700157","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2021","pub-mon":"03","volume":"37","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002700144","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"COVID-19 \uc774\ud6c4 \ud574\uc6b4\xb7\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc8fc\uac00\uc9c0\uc218 \ubcc0\ud654\ubd84\uc11d \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Change of Stock Index in the Shipping and Logistics Industry after COVID-19"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Change of Stock Index in the Shipping and Logistics Industry after COVID-19"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc2ec\ubbfc\uc12d(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc728\uc131(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc804 \uc138\uacc4\ub85c COVID-19\uac00 \ud655\uc0b0\ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\ud68c \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uc608\uc0c1\uce58 \ubabb\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc77c\uc5b4\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70 \uc8fc\uac00\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc678\ubd80\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc798 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \uc9c0\ud45c \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\ud45c\ud558\ub294 FORTUNE GLOBAL 500\ub300 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 2020\ub144 \uc8fc\uac00\uc9c0\uc218\ub97c COVID-19 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ucd08\uae30(1\uc6d4~4\uc6d4), \uc911\uae30(5\uc6d4~8\uc6d4), \ud6c4\uae30(9\uc6d4~12\uc6d4)\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4 \ud574\uc6b4\xb7\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc8fc\uac00\uc9c0\uc218 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc COVID-19 \ubc1c\uc0dd \uc774\ud6c4 56\uac1c \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \uc8fc\uac00\uc99d\uac00\uc728\uc774 0.38%\uc5d0\uc11c 6.52%\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 COVID-19\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc218\ud61c\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud56d\uacf5\uc0b0\uc5c5\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 COVID-19 \ubc1c\uc0dd \ucd08\uae30 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\uc558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ud6c4 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc218\ub2e8\uc758 \uc804\ud658\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ud070 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70 \ubc18\ub300\ub85c \ucca0\ub3c4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uacfc \ud30c\uc774\ud504\ub77c\uc778\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 \uc804\ud658\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ubbf8\ud761\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"* Master program, Korea Maritime and Ocean University (First Author) ** Professor, Korea Maritime and Ocean University (Corresponding Author) \\n\\nSince COVID-19 spreads around the world, there is an unexpected change in the environment and society.

On the other hand, as the smartization strategy is being promoted rather quickly, various problems are expected to occur, but no research has yet suggested ways to comprehensively and systematically analyze expected problems and respond to them. In this study, a group of experts related to the smartening of shipping and logistics in Korea was formed to find problems for each major task for successful implementation of smartification-related policies and to derive improvements. As the Covid-19 crisis, which is occurring around the world, is promoting the smartization of the entire industry, smartization in the shipping and logistics sectors is also expected to proceed quickly.

While a lot of research is being conducted on the blockchain, there are few studies on transaction data stored in the blockchain.

This paper proposes the design of blockchain transaction data in a shipping and port logistics environment by analyzing the export process and related EDI documents."}]},"fpage":"635","lpage":"654","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002665011","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2020","pub-mon":"12","volume":"36","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002664990","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc870\uc120\ud589\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc815\ubd80\uc870\uc9c1 \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Redesign of the Governmental Organization for the shipping and shipbuilding industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Redesign of the Governmental Organization for the shipping and shipbuilding industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ud55c\uc885\uae38(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 4\ucc28\uc0b0\uc5c5\ud601\uba85\uc5d0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ube44\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc6b4\uc870\uc120\uc758 \uacf5\uc0dd\ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud574\uc6b4\uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac15\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ud574\uc6b4\uc870\uc120\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc815\ubd80\uc870\uc9c1 \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc870\uc9c1\uac1c\ud3b8\uc744 \uc704\ud55c 5\uac00\uc9c0 \ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c 1\uc548) \ub300\ud1b5\ub839 \uc9c1\uc18d \uad6d\uac00\ud574\uc591\uc804\ub7b5\ubbf8\ub798\uc704 \uc2e0\uc124, 2\uc548) \ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\ubd80\ub85c \uc77c\uc6d0\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc218\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc870\uc120\ud574\uc591\ud50c\ub79c\ud2b8\uc815\ucc45\uc2e4 \uc2e0\uc124, 3\uc548) \uc0b0\uc5c5\ud1b5\uc0c1\uc790\uc6d0\ubd80\ub85c \uc77c\uc6d0\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc0b0\uc790\ubd80\uc5d0 \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ucc45\uc2e4 \uc2e0\uc124, 4\uc548) \uad6d\ubb34\ucd1d\ub9ac\uc2e4 \uc0b0\ud558\uc5d0 \ud574\uc591\uc815\ucc45\uc870\uc815\uc704 \uc2e0\uc124, 5\uc548) \ud574\uc218\ubd80 \uc7a5\uad00 \uc9c1\uc18d\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uc870\uc120\uc815\ucc45\uc790\ubb38\uc704 \uad6c\uc131 \ub4f1 5\uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\ubd80\ub85c \uc77c\uc6d0\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc870\uc120\ud574\uc591\ud50c\ub79c\ud2b8\uc2e4\uc744 \uc2e0\uc124\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc120\ud638\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubd80\uc870\uc9c1\ubc95 \uc81c 43\uc870\ub97c \uac1c\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\ubd80\ub85c \uc870\uc120 \ubc0f \ud574\uc591\ud50c\ub79c\ud2b8 \uc5c5\ubb34\ub97c \uc774\uad00\ud558\uace0, \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc790\uc6d0\ubd80\uc640 \uadf8 \uc18c\uc18d\uae30\uad00 \uc9c1\uc81c \uc81c12\uc870\u2462\uc5d0\uc11c 70~75\ub97c \uc0ad\uc81c\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\ubd80\uc640 \uadf8 \uc18c\uc18d\uae30\uad00 \uc9c1\uc81c \uc81c3\uc870 \ubc0f 4\uc870\ub97c \uac1c\uc815\ud558\uace0 14\uc870(\uc870\uc120 \ubc0f \ud574\uc591\ud50c\ub79c\uad6d)\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this research is to analyze and to suggest the redesign government system about shipping and shipbuilding industry.

This study aims to analyze the efficiency of domestic container terminals in major ports. DEA analysis was conducted for container terminals located in top five Korean international ports, and window analysis was introduced to see dynamic changes. In addition to the general input variables that increase efficiency, undesirable variables that can decrease the efficiency of the terminal were inserted and analyzed. SBM and Undesirable DEA analysis were introduced to examine the differences in the efficiency of the terminal considering undesirable variable factors. In the SBM analysis result, JUCTC, HPNTC, HJNPC, and PNCOC showed high efficiency, and in the Undesirable DEA, JUCTC, HJNPC, HPNTC, and PNITC showed high efficiency in the descending order of JUCTC, HJNPC, HPNTC, and PNITC. The terminals that showed large differences between the two efficiencies were BNCTC, DPCTC, HJNPC, and HPNTC."}]},"fpage":"509","lpage":"531","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002664735","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2020","pub-mon":"09","volume":"36","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002631113","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d \uc120\uc6d0 \ud574\uc678\ucde8\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uae30\uc5ec, 1965-1999 -\ubbf8\uad6d \uc120\uc0ac \ub77c\uc2a4\ucf54\uc26c\ud551\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Economic Contribution of Korean Seafarers\u2019 Overseas Employment, 1965-1999 - A Case of Lasco Shipping -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Economic Contribution of Korean Seafarers\u2019 Overseas Employment, 1965-1999 - A Case of Lasco Shipping -"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc131\uc900(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \ud574\uc678\ucde8\uc5c5\uc740 \ud55c\uad6d \ud574\uc6b4\uc5c5 \uc131\uc7a5\uc758 \ubc11\uac70\ub984\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \uc774\uc758\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\ub098 \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub098 \uae30\ub150\uc0ac\uc5c5 \ub4f1\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ucd08\ucc3d\uae30 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \ud574\uc678\ucde8\uc5c5\uc744 \uc8fc\ub3c4\ud588\ub358 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc758 \ub77c\uc2a4\ucf54\uc26c\ud551\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ub85d\uc774\ub098 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc804\ubb34\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud55c\uad6d \uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \ub77c\uc2a4\ucf54\uc26c\ud551\uc5d0\uc758 \ud574\uc678\ucde8\uc5c5\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uc678\ud654\ud68d\ub4dd\uc561\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud574\ubcf4\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\ub3c4\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uad00\ub828\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\uc640 \uc790\ub8cc \uc218\uc9d1 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub77c\uc2a4\ucf54\uc26c\ud551\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc5c5\ud55c \ud55c\uad6d \uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0, \uc678\ud654\ud68d\ub4dd\uc561\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud574 \ubcfc \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, 1965\ub144\ubd80\ud130 1999\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 35\ub144\uac04 \ud55c\uad6d \uc120\uc6d0 1\ub9cc 4,384\uba85\uc774 \ubbf8\uad6d \ub77c\uc2a4\ucf54\uc26c\ud551\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc5c5\ud574 \ucd1d 1\uc5b5 7,270\ub9cc\ub2ec\ub7ec\uc758 \uc678\ud654\ub97c \ubc8c\uc5b4\ub4e4\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub294 \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uc790\ub8cc\uc640 \uc0dd\uc874\uc790\ub4e4\uc758 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uc815\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \ud55c\uacc4\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \ud574\uc678\ucde8\uc5c5\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud2b9\uae30\ud560 \uc874\uc7ac\uc600\ub358 \ub77c\uc2a4\ucf54\uc758 \uc2e4\uccb4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c4\uacfc \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc5ec\ud0c0 \ud574\uc678\ucde8\uc5c5\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e4\uccb4\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\ub294 \uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc2dc\uae09\uc131\uc744 \uc54c\ub9ac\ub294 \uacc4\uae30\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper aims to reconstruct the real status of Korean seafarers\u2019 overseas employment in Lasco Shipping and to evaluate the economic contribution to the development of Korean shipping industry.

The degree of operating leverage was about 5 times larger during the boom (6.434) than during the recession (1.381). However, the degree of financial leverage did not show positive effects in both the boom (0.419) and the recession (0.934). It was analyzed that Korean shipping companies showed greater operating risk during boom than recession. However financial risk was not.

The DEA-Window analysis was performed by collecting 10-year data from 2008 to 2017 to examine dynamic efficiency changes. According to the analysis, the efficiency of the companies in the South Sea area was high, and the efficiency of the shipping companies, which changed rapidly over time, led to a decrease in the internal cargo transportation revenue or a decrease in the efficiency of other shipping companies. According to the analysis results, in order to strengthen the operational efficiency of coastal cargo carriers, proper ship volume management measures, demands for technological changes to improve productivity, improvement of coastal shipping infrastructure and support policies for old ships are needed.

The empirical results from full-sample and sub-sample periods shows that a nonlinear analysis including structural change is suitable. Specifically, the estimates with BS(Binary Segmentation) and PELT (Pruned Exact Linear Time) confirm that a large number of breaks have occurred around 2008.

These are the factors relating to the growth of the export market relative to the world export growth (world market effect) and improvements in competitiveness of the exporting port (competitive effect). The Constant Market Share analysis reveals that for Gwangyang Port and Pohang Port the world market effect plays a major role in the period 2014-2018, while the competitiveness effect is the principal component in the period 2010-2014. This study shows that the world market effect is stronger than the competitiveness effect not only over the 2010-2018 period for Busan Port, but the former is weaker than the latter over the same period for Incheon Port, but there is no significant gap between the two effects. Pyeongtaek Port\u2019s export growth is above world export growth, driven by competitive effect."}]},"fpage":"243","lpage":"259","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002597736","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2020","pub-mon":"06","volume":"36","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002597696","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud1a0\ud53d\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988 \uad00\uad11\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Content Analysis of Cruise Attributes based on Topic Modeling"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Content Analysis of Cruise Attributes based on Topic Modeling"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc131\uad6d(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc9c4\uc6b1(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc120\ubc15\uc6b4\ud56d\uacfc)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc624\ub298\ub0a0 \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988\uc120 \uc6b4\ud56d\uc740 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud654\ubb3c\uc120\uacfc \uc5ec\uac1d\uc120 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c4\ud654\ub41c \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\uc5c5\ubd84\uc57c \uac00\uc6b4\ub370 \ud558\ub098\ub85c\uc11c \uad00\uc2ec\uc744 \ubc1b\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988\uc120\uc758 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacfc \ub2ec\ub9ac B2C \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4\ub85c\uc11c \uace0\uac1d\ub4e4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uac1c\ubcc4 \ud310\ub2e8\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc2b9\uc120\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba70 \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud589\ub3d9\ubaa8\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc815\ubcf4\uae30\uc220\uc758 \ubc1c\ub2ec\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \uc18c\ube44\uc790\ub294 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud6c4\uae30\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud488\uc744 \uad6c\ub9e4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uad6c\uc804\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc774 \uce58\uc5f4\ud55c \uce90\ub7ec\ube44\uc548 \ud574\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ucde8\ud56d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988\uc120\uc744 \uc2b9\uc120\ud55c \uad6c\ub9e4\ud6c4\uae30\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc815\uc131\uc801 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc758 \ud6c4\uae30\ub97c \uc815\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294\ub370 \ucf54\ud37c\uc2a4 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud14d\uc2a4\ud2b8\ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\ube44\uc790\uc758 \ub2c8\uc988\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988\uc120\uc758 \uad6c\ub9e4\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub294 \uac1d\uc2e4, \uc5ec\ud589\uc77c\uc815, \uc694\ub9ac, \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988 \uc120\uc0ac, \uc120\uccb4\uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud06c\ub8e8\uc988 \uad00\uad11\uc758 \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc18c\ube44\uc790 \ub2c8\uc988 \ud30c\uc545\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud6c4\uc18d \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Today, cruise ship operation is drawing attention as one of the major business areas of shipping companies that have evolved from the existing cargo and passenger ship business.

To this end, thirteen individual Korean feeder shipping companies are categorized into three possible alliances using K-mean clustering in terms of similarity of cargo carried by the carriers. Efficiency for the three alliances was measured through a multi-stage DEA which consists of fleet efficiency, loading efficiency, value efficiency and overall efficiency. It is found that there is a significant difference in efficiency scores among individual shipping companies, and that virtual formation of alliances would have a positive impact on the efficiency of individual shipping companies. It is also shown that difference in fleet and loading efficiencies between alliances is larger that value and overall efficiencies."}]},"fpage":"181","lpage":"198","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002597604","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2020","pub-mon":"06","volume":"36","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002597577","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud654\ubb3c, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778, \ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc774 \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on Determinants of Freight Fluctuation in Air Transportation"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on Determinants of Freight Fluctuation in Air Transportation"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ub450\ud76c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\ud601\uc218(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6d0\uc790\uc7ac\ub97c \uc218\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uac00\uacf5\ud574\uc11c \uc218\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ubb34\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uc6b4\uc784\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \ubb34\uc5ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc544\uc8fc \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubc18\ub3c4\uccb4, IT \uc81c\ud488 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc8fc\ub825 \uc218\ucd9c\ud488\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud654\ubb3c, \uc6b4\uc784, \ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub3c4 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud558\uba74 \ubd80\ub300\uc694\uae08\uc758 \ube44\uc911, \uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ud574\uc218\uc900, \ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \uc5c5\ub825\uc774 \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc791\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \ud568\uaed8, \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \uad00\ub828 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801, \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacfc\uc81c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc81c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Due to the economic structure importing raw materials and exporting products, transportation with competitive freight can play an important role in Korean trade. Incheon Airport is much bigger regarding number and price of international trade in Korea. The competitiveness of air transport depends on various factors. One of them is air freight. This study aims at researching air transport and freight. In specific, this study is designed to find determinants of freight fluctuation in air cargo. Air freight can be fluctuated depending on various factors such as cargo, consignee, carrier, and etc. Also, freight fluctuation can be relevant to service performance in air transport. This study tries to show important determinants and effect of freight fluctuation based on previous research and empirical findings. It is found that surcharge ratio, how much understand contract terms, and how long do business can be relevant to decrease freight fluctuation. Also, lower freight fluctuation better service satisfaction in air transport. Despite its contributions, there are some limitations. We could not find all possible determinants of freight fluctuation. It is required for future research so as to find comprehensive determinants and effects."}]},"fpage":"161","lpage":"180","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":null,"citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002597577","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2020","pub-mon":"06","volume":"36","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002597538","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"SNA\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\ubbf8\uc8fc \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Structural analysis of the liner shipping network of the Asia-North America trade route adopting Social Network Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Structural analysis of the liner shipping network of the Asia-North America trade route adopting Social Network Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc815\ud589(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\uc131\ud6c8(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc774\ud574\ucc2c(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0 \uc11d\uc0ac\uacfc\uc815)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\ubbf8\uc8fc \ud574\uc6b4\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 SNA \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\ubbf8\uc8fc \ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0 \uae30\ud56d\uc911\uc778 56\uac1c \ud56d\ub85c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, 29\uac1c\uad6d 89\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \uc5f0\uacb0\uc911\uc2ec\uc131 \uc911 Out Degree\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 Busan\ud56d\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc21c\uc704\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, Singapore\ud56d, Kaohsiung\ud56d, Oakland\ud56d, Yantian, Tokyo\ud56d\uc774 \ub4a4\ub97c \uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4.

The government institutions have increased the supply of ship finance to fill the gap of ship finance in Korea. Accordingly, the dominance of the government institutions is reinforced. The active involvement of private financiers is needed to develop a sustainable ship finance market in Korea. It is recommended for the government institutions to accompany private financiers in their ship investment projects which are regarded as good risk deals.

An analysis of social mining of big data was used in this study. According to the results of a trend analysis by media, the media attention increased when a voluntary arrangement was applied in April 2016 and reached a crescendo when Hanjin Shipping filed for court receivership in August. On February 17, 2017, in particular, the declaration of bankruptcy of Hanjin Shipping was exposed in social media with high frequency. The results of sentiment analysis of positive and negative trends showed that \u201cpositive sentiment words\u201d (32.6%) were higher than \u201cnegative sentiment words\u201d (28.4%) on Hanjin Shipping in 2015.

Hazardous accidents were classified as four accident factors: human factors, physical factors, other factors, and unknown causes, and the validity of the simulation model was verified by comparing the simulated results with the data on hazardous accident."}]},"fpage":"601","lpage":"615","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2019.35.4.601","uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002535800","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2019","pub-mon":"12","volume":"35","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002535794","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub178\ub3d9\uc801 CSR \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc870\uc9c1\ubab0\uc785\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 : \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Effect of Labor CSR Perception on Organizational Commitment in the Logistics Industry: A Case Study of Korean Freight Forwarding Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Effect of Labor CSR Perception on Organizational Commitment in the Logistics Industry: A Case Study of Korean Freight Forwarding Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uace0\uc9c0\uc601(\ubd80\uc0b0\ud14c\ud06c\ub178\ud30c\ud06c)","\uae40\uc0c1\uc5f4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc7a5\ud604\ubbf8(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5 \uc885\uc0ac\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \u2018\ub178\ub3d9\uc801 CSR\u2019 \uc778\uc2dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc9c1\ubb34\ub9cc\uc871, \uc870\uc9c1\uc2e0\ub8b0 \ubc0f \uc870\uc9c1\ubab0\uc785\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubd04\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5 \uc870\uc9c1 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubd80\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0 \uc18c\uc7ac\ud55c \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uccb4\ub97c \ubc29\ubb38\ud558\uc5ec \uc124\ubb38\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac00\uc124\uac80\uc815\uacfc \uc2e4\uc99d\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud574 SPSS/AMOS Ver. 18.0\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d, \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub3c4\ubd84\uc11d, \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4 \ubd84\uc11d, \uad6c\uc870\ubc29\uc815\uc2dd \ubaa8\ud615\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ub3c5\ub9bd\ubcc0\uc218\uc778 \u2018\ub178\ub3d9\uc801 CSR\u2019\uc740 \uc9c1\ubb34\ub9cc\uc871, \uc870\uc9c1\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\ucce4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc870\uc9c1\ubab0\uc785\uc5d0\ub294 \uc720\uc758\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub9e4\uac1c \ubcc0\uc218\uc778 \uc9c1\ubb34\ub9cc\uc871\uacfc \uc870\uc9c1\uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc870\uc9c1\ubab0\uc785\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5 \uc885\uc0ac\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \uc870\uc9c1\ubab0\uc785\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc885\uc0ac\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \ub9cc\uc871\uacfc \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \u2018\ub178\ub3d9\uc801 CSR\u2019 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"International freight forwarder\u2019s job satisfaction, organizational trust and organizational commitment are closely associated to not only job performance but also the sustainable operation of the business.

The relationship between firms should be studied from a strategic viewpoint, and examining the strategic usage of an IS and its gaps in performance is important from an international freight forwarder viewpoints. This study analyzes such gaps among the different levels of the strategic IS. The study population is international freight forwarders. Hence, investigating the strategic IS and gaps in performance can provide better understanding of port logistics services. Data are analyzed using various methods. Reliability and validity are verified via factor analysis and Cronbach\u2019s alpha, and the relationships between variables are analyzed by various analytical methods. The results are as follows.

As of 2018, China\'s three major state-owned airlines accounted for nearly 70% of the air transport market, but the rapid rise of LCCs has reduced profits of the state-owned airlines by 50%. This study examines competition and cooperation in the Chinese airlines industry, which includes state-owned airlines, large private airlines, and LCCs, and suggests policy options for improving the overall efficiency of the industry. In addition, an analysis of Granger causality demonstrates a competitive relationship between large state-owned airlines and LCCs. Finally, analyzing the error correction model and its impact response function showed that a 1% change in demand has a significant impact on competition between large state-owned carriers and LCCs."}]},"fpage":"429","lpage":"453","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2019.35.3.429","uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002505248","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2019","pub-mon":"09","volume":"35","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002505245","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd81\ud55c \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uad8c\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Evaluation of Port Choice Factors in the West Coast Bay of North Korea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Evaluation of Port Choice Factors in the West Coast Bay of North Korea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\ub3d9\ud654(\ubd81\ud55c\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\ubc18\ub3c4\uc758 \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uad8c\uc740 \ub3d9\ub0a8\uc544\uc2dc\uc544, \ud0dc\ud3c9\uc591, \uc911\uad6d\uc758 \ub3d9\ubd813\uc131, \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \ub4f1 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\uce58\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubd81\ud55c\uc740 \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uacbd\uc81c\ud2b9\uad6c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc81c\ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uba70 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ub0a8\ubd81 \ud611\ub825 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc740 \ub0a8\ubd81\ud55c\uacfc \uc911\uad6d\ub3d9\ubd81 3\uc131 \ubc0f \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \ub4f1 \uc720\ub77c\uc2dc\uc544 \uc5f0\uacc4\ub41c \uad6d\uc81c \ubcf5\ud569\ubb3c\ub958\ub9dd \uad6c\ucd95\uc774 \ubaa9\ud45c\uc774\ub2e4. \ubd81\ud55c\uc758 \uc11c\ud574\uc548 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uc740 \ub0a8\ubd81\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\ub3d9\uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \uacf5\ub3d9\uc6b4\uc601\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 \ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd81\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801 \uc815\ucc45\ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uce21\uc815\uc601\uc5ed\uacfc \uce21\uc815\uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ubc29\ubc95\uc740 AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac \ub4f1\uc758 \ubbfc\uac04\ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uacf5\uae30\uad00\uc774 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\uba70. \uc81c2\uacc4\uce35\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc18d\uc131\uc740 \ud574\uc6b4\xb7\ud56d\ub9cc \uae30\ubc18 \uad6c\ucd95\uc774 0.296\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uce58\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubd81\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc \uc120\ud0dd \uc138\ubd80 \ud3c9\uac00\uc694\uc18c\uc758 \uc885\ud569\uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub294 \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \uad00\ub828\uae30\uad00\uc774 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \uad6c\ucd95\uc774 0.073\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd81\ud55c \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uc758 \ucd5c\uc885\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uc120\ud0dd\uc740 \uc2e0\uc758\uc8fc\ud2b9\uad6c\ub85c 0.345\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uc758\uc8fc \ud2b9\uad6c\ub294 \ubd81\ud55c \uc678\uc5d0 \uc911\uad6d \ub2e8\ub3d9\uacfc \uc5f0\uacc4\uc131\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub192\uc73c\uba70 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubc95\uc801 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \uc6b4\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The west coast bay of the Korean Peninsula is located in China\'s three northeastern provinces and Russia.

The key findings of this study are summarized as follows. First, as a result of estimating the conditional variance model, the BDI had a reverse leverage effect after the GFC, and the HRCI had no leverage effect. Second, the long-memory analysis using the Hurst exponent indicated that the long-memory effect of marine freight volatility, expressed as an absolute value, on marine freight exchange rate was reduced after the GFC. In addition, long- memory of HRCI volatility was found to be greater than that of BDI volatility after the GFC. The results of this study will be meaningful in setting strategic directions for suppressing marine freight risks in the shipping and port sectors."}]},"fpage":"365","lpage":"386","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2019.35.3.365","uci":null,"citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002505228","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2019","pub-mon":"06","volume":"35","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002477916","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"4\ucc28 \uc0b0\uc5c5\ud601\uba85\uc2dc\ub300 \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud56d\ub9cc \uc218\uc900 \uce21\uc815\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Analysis on the Level of the Korean Smart Port in the Era of 4th Industrial Revolution"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Analysis on the Level of the Korean Smart Port in the Era of 4th Industrial Revolution"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc5b8\uacbd(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0)","\uc774\uc218\uc601(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud604\uc7ac \uc138\uacc4 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc120\uc9c4\ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc740 \uc644\uc804\uc790\ub3d9\ud654\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ud654\xb7\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ud654\ub97c \ubcf8\uaca9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubc18\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\ubd84\uc57c\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac \uc138\uacc4 \ucd5c\uace0\uc218\uc900 \ub300\ube44 \uc548\ubcbd \ubc0f \uc774\uc1a1 \ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc5f0\uacc4\uac00 \ubbf8\ud761\ud558\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc678\ubd80 \uc601\uc5ed\uc778 \ud574\uc6b4 \ubc0f \ubc30\ud6c4\uc9c0\uc640\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc \ub124\ub35c\ub780\ub4dc, \uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974\ud56d \ub300\ube44 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\ubd84\uc57c\uc758 4\ucc28 \uc0b0\uc5fd\ud601\uba85 \uae30\uc220 \ub3c4\uc785 \ubc0f \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc \uad6c\ucd95 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ub354\ub518 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc9c1\uc5c5\uc804\ud658\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub178\ub3d9\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc774 \ub0ae\uace0, \ub370\uc774\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \ubc95\xb7\uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \uc815\ube44, \ud50c\ub7ab\ud3fc \uc124\uacc4 \ub2a5\ub825 \ub4f1\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc870\uc0ac\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8\uace0\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\ubd84\uc57c\uc758 4\ucc28 \uc0b0\uc5c5\ud601\uba85 \uae30\uc220 \ub300\uc751 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uace0\uc2dc\ud0a4\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294\ub2e4\uba74 2030\ub144\ub300\uc5d0\ub294 \uc120\uc9c4\ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\xb7\ub514\uc9c0\ud138\ud654 \uc218\uc900 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ub354\uc6b1 \uc2ec\ud654 \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub9dd\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uc751 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud588\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"We compare the preparation level of Korean ports with that of the world\u2019s best ports in the era of the 4th industrial revolution through focus interviews and expert survey.

In the VECM regression analysis, this study could find that the LNG carrier freight rates finally converge toward the freight rates at long-term equilibrium even irrespective of whether there is a economic boom or recession in LNG transport market. In summary, this study concludes that LNG carrier freight rates will eventually converge toward the rates at long-term equilibrium point irrespective of a economic boom or depression.\\nAnd it is expected that comparison analysis of the results of each study that include many kind of carrier like container, bulk, tank, and so on will provide more meaningful results in next our research."}]},"fpage":"145","lpage":"161","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2019.35.1.145","uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002450010","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2019","pub-mon":"03","volume":"35","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002450007","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"BDI, \uc720\uac00, \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc18c\ub4dd\uc774 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc218\uc785\ub2e8\uac00\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Effects of BDI, Petroleum Price, and Real Income on Import Unit Value in Korean Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Effects of BDI, Petroleum Price, and Real Income on Import Unit Value in Korean Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc2ec\uc7ac\ud76c(\uc870\uc120\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\ucc3d\ubc94(\uc870\uc120\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2000\ub144 1\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130 2018\ub144 12\uc6d4\uae4c\uc9c0 \uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud45c\uc900\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\uc11d\ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc784, \uc720\uac00, \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc18c\ub4dd\uc774 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc218\uc785\ub2e8\uac00\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc758 \ud06c\uae30, \ubc29\ud5a5 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc18d\uc815\ub3c4\uc758 \ud30c\uc545\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uad00\uacc4\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \uc218\uc785\ub2e8\uac00\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc2e4\uc9c8\uc18c\ub4dd, \uc720\uac00, \uc6b4\uc784 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ub2e8\uae30\uc801 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc5d0\uc11c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc870\uc815\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uc624\ucc28\uc218\uc815\ud56d\uc774 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc74c(-)\uc758 \uac12\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc90c\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uacf5\uc801\ubd84\uac80\uc815\uacfc \uc77c\uce58\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ub3c4\uc785\ub41c \ub3c5\ub9bd\ubcc0\uc218 \ucda9\uaca9\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc218\uc785\ub2e8\uac00 \ubc18\uc751\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uc9c0\uc18d\uae30\uac04\uc740 \uc720\uac00\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud06c\uace0 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc218\ub9bd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \uad00\uc810, \uc218\uc785\ub2e8\uac00 \uc804\ub9dd\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud559\uc220\uc801 \uad00\uc810, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958 \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ucc38\uace0\uc790\ub8cc\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc758\ubbf8\ub97c \uac00\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to investigate the factors affecting the change of port import unit value in the short and long term by the standard time series analysis method from January 2000 to December 2018.

features, status, major institutions, market structure and so on, and derive measures for the revitalization of Korean domestic shipbuilding finance.\\nKorea which is a three-sided sea is now carrying out 99 percent of its exports and imports through sea transport and the shipping and shipbuilding industries is important for Korea\u2019s sustainable economy growth. However, now the long-standing slump in shipping and shipbuilding industries has made related companies suffer from deteriorating management performance. Therefore, smooth and sustained shipping financing is required to revitalize the Korean shipping and shipbuilding business and this study suggests that it is essential that the government and financial institutions should provide financial support for building new ship with especially high operational efficiency with a long-term strategy.\\nThis research was to examine the Japanese ship finance market, which provided stable ship financing since the 1940s, and to derive the advantages and disadvantages of the Japanese ship financing system. The Japanese case study, which has established a stable system to finance ships despite the recession, is expected to serve as a milestone for Korea\'s need for a stable ship financing market structure to secure the competitiveness of the shipping and shipbuilding industries.\\nIn particular, it is expected that this study could be a reference material for the establishment of policies by the government(Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) that announced a \u2018five-year plan for shipbuilding industry reconstruction\u2019 with the launch of the Korea Maritime Promotion Agency in 2018."}]},"fpage":"111","lpage":"132","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2019.35.1.111","uci":null,"citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002450004","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2019","pub-mon":"03","volume":"35","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002449998","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud63c\ud569\uc8fc\uae30 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30\ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\ub825 \uac80\uc815"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The forecasting evaluation of the high-order mixed frequency time series model to the marine industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The forecasting evaluation of the high-order mixed frequency time series model to the marine industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\ud604\uc11d(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud63c\ud569\uc8fc\uae30\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ube44\uc120\ud615 \uc7a5\uae30\uade0\ud615\uad00\uacc4\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ud55c \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ub2e8\uae30\ubaa8\ud615\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac00\uc7a5 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ub2e8\uc77c\ubcc0\uc218(univariate) AR(1) \ubaa8\ud615\uacfc \ud63c\ud569\uc8fc\uae30\ubaa8\ud615\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uac01\uac01 \ud45c\ubcf8\uc678 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\uc624\ucc28\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ud63c\ud569\uc8fc\uae30\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc774 AR(1) \ubaa8\ud615\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uace0\ucc28\uc6d0 \ud63c\ud569\uc8fc\uae30\ubaa8\ud615\uc774 \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30\ubcc0\ub3d9 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \ubaa8\ud615\uc784\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\uba70, \uc989, \ucd5c\uadfc \ub2e4\ubcc0\uc218 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc790\ub8cc\uac00 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc7a5\uae30\uade0\ud615\uad00\uacc4(long-run equilibrium)\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uace0\ucc28\uc8fc\uae30\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub2e8\uae30 \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30 \ubd84\uc11d\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uc608\uce21\ub825\uc774 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study applied the statistically significant factors to the short-run model in the existing nonlinear long-run equilibrium relation analysis for the forecasting of maritime economy using the mixed cycle model.

The empirical results from the analysis suggest that the new approach of high-level mixed frequency model is a useful for forecasting marine industry.

As a result of these innovations, MASS are spreading. MASS means a vessel operated by an unmanned person without using judgment, ability or power of a person. Although the proliferation of MASS is expected to accelerate, there is little research on legislation, policy, technology, and social consensus in line with this situation. Therefore, this study analyzed future issues in legal, technical, and social perspectives for the implementation and activation of MASS and suggested policy proposals. In conclusion, social consensus for the development of MASS should be preceded. Second, the law should be enacted for the introduction and activation of MASS. and in the international community, we should insist on our opinion on MASS."}]},"fpage":"73","lpage":"91","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2019.35.1.73","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002449996","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2019","pub-mon":"03","volume":"35","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002449992","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc758 \uc900\uac70\ubc95, \uc9c0\uc0c1\uc57d\uad00, \uc7ac\ud310\uad00\ud560\uc57d\uad00\uc758 \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Legal Aspects of Governing Law Clause, Paramount Clause, Jurisdiction Clause under Bill of Lading"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Legal Aspects of Governing Law Clause, Paramount Clause, Jurisdiction Clause under Bill of Lading"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc81c\ud604(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\uc591\ud654(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc9c0\uc0c1\uc57d\uad00\uc758 \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc740 \uc800\ucd09\ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc815\uc124, \uc2e4\uc9c8\ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc815\uc124, \uc900\uac70\ubc95\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84\uc9c0\uc815\uc124\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\uc57d\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790 \uc790\uce58\ub97c \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \uc900\uac70\ubc95\uc758 \ubd80\ubd84\uc9c0\uc815\uc124\ub85c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc9c0\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc77c\ubcf8\ubc95\uc6d0\ub3c4 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\uc57d\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790 \uc790\uce58\ub97c \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \uc2e4\uc9c8\ubc95\uc801 \uc9c0\uc815\uc124\ub85c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \ud604\uc7ac \ud574\uc6b4\ud68c\uc0ac\uac00 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc758 \uc900\uac70\ubc95\uc57d\uad00\uacfc \uc9c0\uc0c1\uc57d\uad00\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \uc7ac\ud310\uad00\ud560\uc57d\uad00\uc758 \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc740 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778, \uc1a1\ud558\uc778, \uc218\ud558\uc778, \uc120\uc758\uc758 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc18c\uc9c0\uc778, \uc7ac\ud310\uad00\ud560\ubc95\uc6d0\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uad6d\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\uc57d \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790 \uc790\uce58\ub97c \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \uc7ac\ud310\uad00\ud560\uc57d\uad00\uc744 \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801 \uc694\uac74\uc744 \ucda9\uc871\uc2dc\ucf1c\uc57c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ud6a8\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \uc120\uc758\uc758 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c \uc18c\uc9c0\uc778 \uc740\ud589, \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\ud68c\uc0ac\ub294 \uc7ac\ud310\uad00\ud560\uc57d\uad00\uc73c\ub85c \uc18c\uc1a1\uc9c0\uc640 \ubc95\uc6d0\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \ub54c \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\uc57d\uccb4\uacb0\uc9c0, \ubd88\ubc95\ud589\uc704\uc9c0, \uc120\uc801\uc9c0, \uc591\ub959\uc9c0 \ub4f1\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uc785\uc99d\uc758 \ud3b8\uc758, \uc601\uc5c5 \uc18c\uc7ac\uc9c0, \uc18c\uc1a1\ubb3c\uc758 \uac00\uc561 \ub4f1\uc758 \uac1d\uad00\uc801 \uc694\uc18c\uc640 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uacc4\uc57d\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc758 \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud569\uc758\ub0b4\uc6a9, \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc758 \uc758\ub3c4, \uacbd\uc601\uc790\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uacb0\uc815 \ub4f1 \uc8fc\uad00\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc0bc\uc544\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The carrier paramount clauses in the bill of lading to enjoy the advantages of the limitation of liability and exception clauses in the international regulation. it is inevitable that there could be an interpretation conflict between the paramounts clause and governing laws.

The trading volume have grown tremendously with FTA agreement between two countries. This study is intended to analyze performance of Koran and Chinese shipping companies based on Malmquist productivity index. We could use assets, capital, and employees as input variables to calculate the index. Also, sale was used as an output variable. The results indicate that the productivity index of Chinese shipping companies has increased despite the relatively high volatility. The index of Korean shipping companies was not high enough but it was stable. Chinese shipping companies keep working hard to improve efficiency and productivity. This is why the index of Chinese shipping companies have increased. However, the index of Korean shipping companies is not good enough.

The Imabari Maritime Cluster is equipped with complete domestic demand conditions and related supporting industry conditions. Although the strengths of the production conditions include excellent family-based management and strong support from regional administration and banks which develops independency among cluster members, the weak points include the absense of robust port services and difficulty in recruiting young talent in small and medium-sized cities.

This will include the development of marine healing facilities and strengthening forest healing connectivity, emphasizing the development of highly specialized medical technologies. The second priority is value creation in marine healing specialization, accompanied by an integrated and systematic policy for research and development of new medicines in marine healing effects.

Based on the fuzzy analysis process, the importance of major policy programs for the development of green ports in Korea was compared and analyzed. As a result of importance analysis, the Green Ship Incentive Program and the Carbon Footprint Program were identified as the most important policies. The first policy programs that should be introduced to Incheon Port are the AMP installation operation program and a vessel slowing program around the seaport. In case of Busan \u200b\u200bPort, the AMP installation operation program, the vessel slowing program around the seaport, carbon footprint, and installation of DPF were found to be excellent policies. These results may provide practical implications for policy makers of port authorities which has conducted environmental projects."}]},"fpage":"657","lpage":"675","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.4.657","uci":null,"citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002418060","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"12","volume":"34","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002418046","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uac15\uc6d0\uc601\ub3d9\ub0a8\ubd80\uad8c \ub0b4\ub959\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0 \uc785\uc9c0\uacbd\uc7c1\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Locational Competitiveness Factor of Inland Logistics Complex in Gangwon"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Locational Competitiveness Factor of Inland Logistics Complex in Gangwon"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubbfc\uc138\ud64d(\ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc13c\ud130)","\uc815\ub3d9\ud6c8(\ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc13c\ud130)","\uac15\ub2ec\uc6d0(\uac00\ud1a8\ub9ad\uad00\ub3d9\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uac15\uc6d0\uc601\ub3d9\ub0a8\ubd80\uad8c \ub0b4\ub959\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0 \ud544\uc694\uc131 \ubc0f \uc785\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc704\ud574, \uac15\uc6d0\uad8c \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ucd94\uc815 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ub959\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0 \uc785\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \uac15\uc6d0\uad8c \uc0b0\uc5c5\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc0b0\ucd9c \uac00\ub2a5 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc740 775\ub9cc \ud1a4\uc774\uba70, \ub0b4\ub959\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0\uc758 \uc870\uc131\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc740 \uae30\uc885\uc810 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc740 \uc6d0\uc8fc\uc2dc\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub0b4\ub959\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc7c1 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 28\uac1c \ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud574\ub2f9 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc 16\uac1c\uc758 \uc694\uc18c\uac00 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

Litigation ensued between those in the charterparty chain. When the hull insurer, Gard, took an assignment of the rights of the vessel\u2019s owners and demise charterers in a claim against the time charterers that the vessel had been ordered by them to an unsafe port in breach of the charter. Although the claim succeeded, the Court of Appeal overturned the decision. The Supreme Court delivered its judgment on May 10, 2017, dealing with three important issues, safe port, joint insurance, and limitation of liability. Especially on the safe port issue, the court held that the port was not unsafe within the meaning of the safe port undertaking so the charterers were not in breach of it. The conditions in the port amounted to an abnormal occurrence as that expression is understood."}]},"fpage":"583","lpage":"613","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.4.583","uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002418004","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"12","volume":"34","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002417997","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ubb3c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c\uc694\uc778\ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Factor Evaluation for Risk Management of Hazardous Substance at Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Factor Evaluation for Risk Management of Hazardous Substance at Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc724\ub3d9\ud558(\ud55c\uad6d\uad6d\uc81c\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc8fc\uc2dd\ud68c\uc0ac)","\uae40\uc120\uad6c(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc11d(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc704\ud5d8\ubb3c \uc0ac\uace0 \ub4f1\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \uc548\uc804\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\ubb3c \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc694\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc778 \ubd80\uc0b0, \uad11\uc591, \uc778\ucc9c, \uc6b8\uc0b0\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\ubb3c \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\uc640 Fuzzy-AHP \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucd1d 3\uac1c\uc758 \uce21\uc815 \uc601\uc5ed\uacfc 9\uac1c\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \uce21\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \uce21\uc815 \uc601\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uc801\uc790\uc6d0(HR) \uad00\ub9ac\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4(0.445)\uac00 \ub192\uac8c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud658\uc0b0 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uc138\ubd80 \uce21\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad00\ub9ac\uc790 \uc219\ub828\ub3c4 \ud655\ubcf4(0.158), \uad00\ub9ac \uc778\uc6d0 \uc5c5\ubb34 \uac1c\uc120(0.150), \uc548\uc804\uad50\uc721 \uac15\ud654(0.136)\uac00 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc21c\uc704\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is evaluate factor for risk management of hazardous substance at ports.

The validity of derivation of centrality rankings was enhanced by using the connection centrality that reflected weights, which had not been applied in previous research. The results of the connection centrality analysis indicated that the network composition ratio of the South Sea region was high, and the results of analysis of betweenness centrality indicated that ports belonging to the South Sea region recorded high ranks. Jeju Island, which acts as a gateway to the West Sea and the South Sea, Mokpo, which acts as a gateway between the land and islands, those ports that are geographically close to the land, and those ports that are smoothly connected to small ports, were shown to have betweenness centrality. Meanwhile, in the results of analysis of eigenvector centrality, not only ports in the South Sea region but also many ports in the West Sea region were included in the high ranked ones. Using these results, the port authority can identify major ports in domestic coastal shipping, determine the priorities support, identify the current situation of the port connection relations, and establish strategies for management of key development areas. As future studies, studies in the aspect of economy that separate general passengers and island passengers and utilize data such as fares, distances, and time are necessary."}]},"fpage":"527","lpage":"544","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.4.527","uci":null,"citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002417975","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"09","volume":"34","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002386870","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc120\uc9c4\uc0ac\ub840 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Advanced Case Analysis and Implications of a Smart Seaport"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Advanced Case Analysis and Implications of a Smart Seaport"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc815\ud0dc\uc6d0(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc \uad00\ub828 \ud504\ub85c\uc81d\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc720\ub7fd\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac\uc640 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae30\uc5c5 \uac04\uc5d0 \ud611\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc9c4\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uad6d\ub0b4\uc678 \uc800\ub110\uc5d0 \ubc1c\ud45c\ub41c \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ub9ce\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70 \ud2b9\ud788, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uc6b4\uc601\uacc4\ud68d \ubc0f \uc138\ubd80\ubc29\uc548\ub4e4\uc774 \ub9c8\ub828\ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc720\ub7fd\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc55e\uc11c\uac00\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud568\ubd80\ub974\ud06c\uc640 \ub85c\ud14c\ub974\ub2f4 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud574\ubcf4\uace0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uba74 \uccab\uc9f8, \uba3c\uc800 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\ube44\uc804 \ubc0f \ucd94\uc9c4\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc138\uc6b0\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc640\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4, \uc120\ubc15 \ubc0f \uc870\uc120\uc758 \ubbf8\ub798 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc0c1\ud669 \uc774\ud574, \uc120\uc9c4 \ud56d\ub9cc\uae30\uc220 \ubd84\uc57c \ubc0f \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \ub4f1\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c\ud558\uba70 \ub458\uc9f8, \ud56d\ub9cc\uad00\ub828 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc640 IT\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640\uc758 \uc720\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uacc4, \ucc38\uc5ec\uc640 \uc18c\ud1b5\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uce5c\ud658\uacbd \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\uc131 \ud56d\ub9cc, \ub514\uc9c0\ud138 \ud56d\ub9cc, \ud0c4\uc18c\uc800\uac10 \ud56d\ub9cc, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \uc774\uc6a9 \ud56d\ub9cc \ub4f1\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 KPI\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub137\uc9f8, \uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c R&D \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc758 \ubc1c\uad74\uacfc \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \uc591\uc9c8\uc758 \uc77c\uc790\ub9ac \ucc3d\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ud50c\ub79c\uc774 \uc900\ube44\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Smart Port projects are long-term plans that are primarily carried out in Europe by the local Port Authority and global companies.

Intra-Asian container cargo volume constitutes 34% of the global seaborne container cargo. Global mega- carriers have been expanding their businesses in Asia to discover new sources of revenue after the collapse of the shipping market in 2008. Major global shipping companies have started intra-Asia services. We examined the entrance of 12 global shipping companies into the Asian shipping market every four years between 2000 and 2016, using the Social Network Analysis (SNA) technique. We found that the degree and density of intra-Asian shipping networks of global liners have increased by about four times during this period. In addition, global shipping companies have adopted the Hub-and-Spoke system in intra-Asia networks to separate their services into main and feeder hauls, as in the case of MCC Transport, a subsidiary liner of Maersk."}]},"fpage":"447","lpage":"471","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.3.447","uci":null,"citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002386867","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"09","volume":"34","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002386865","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uace0\uae30\uc220\uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4, \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uaddc\ubaa8, \ud574\uc678\uc9c1\uc811\ud22c\uc790\uac00 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c \uc218\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5: \ud328\ub110\ubd84\uc11d\uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Impact of High-Tech Intensity, E-commerce Scale, and Overseas Direct Investment on Air Cargo Exports in Korea: Panel Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Impact of High-Tech Intensity, E-commerce Scale, and Overseas Direct Investment on Air Cargo Exports in Korea: Panel Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\ucc3d\ubc94(\uc870\uc120\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2001\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2016\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc218\ucd9c\uad6d\uc778 15\uac1c\uad6d\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ucd9c\uc0c1\ub300\uad6d\uc758 \uace0\uae30\uc220\uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4, \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uaddc\ubaa8, \uc218\ucd9c\uc0c1\ub300\uad6d\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud574\uc678\uc9c1\uc811\ud22c\uc790\uac00 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c \uc218\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud328\ub110 FMOLS\uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uc218\ucd9c\uc0c1\ub300\uad6d\uc758 \uace0\uae30\uc220\uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4\uc640 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uaddc\ubaa8\uac00 1% \ubcc0\ud654\ud560 \ub54c \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c \uc218\ucd9c\uc561\uc774 \uac01\uac01 0.39%\uc640 0.02% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \uc218\ucd9c\uc0c1\ub300\uad6d\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud574\uc678\uc9c1\uc811\ud22c\uc790\uc561\uc774 1% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74 \uc218\ucd9c\uc561\uc774 0.04% \uac10\uc18c\ud568\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c, \ubcf8\uace0\ub294 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c \uc218\ucd9c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad50\uc5ed\ub300\uc0c1\uad6d \uc18c\ub4dd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ub2c8\ud130\ub9c1, FTA\uccb4\uacb0 \ud655\ub300\ub85c \ubb34\uc5ed\uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc99d\ub300, \uc218\ucd9c\uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uace0\ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac1c\ubc1c\ud22c\uc790 \ud655\ub300, \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ud655\ub300\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \uc815\ube44 \ubc0f \ud574\uc678\uc9c1\uc811\ud22c\uc790 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucd95\uc18c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub9ac\uc1fc\uc5b4\ub9c1\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study examines the impact of factors such as high technology intensity, e-commerce scale, and overseas direct investment (ODI) in fifteen countries that were major export destinations of Korean air cargo in 2016, on exports of air cargo.

When real GDP per capita, export unit price, trade openness, high-technology intensity, and e-commerce scale increased by 1%, air cargo exports increased by 1.13%, 0.73%, 0.42%, 0.39%, and 0.02%, respectively, whereas a 1% increase in ODI led to a 0.04% decrease in export value. Thus, to increase Korean air freight exports, it is necessary to monitor the economies and income levels of trading partner countries continuously. It is also necessary to increase trade volume through continuous expansion of the FTA and continuous technology development, identify high-technology items of trading partner countries, rearrange policies and systems to expand e-commerce, and reshore through a strategic reduction of ODI."}]},"fpage":"431","lpage":"445","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.3.431","uci":null,"citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002386865","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"09","volume":"34","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002386864","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790 \ub3d9\uc870\ud654 \uacbd\ud5a5 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis of Korean Shipping Companies\u2019 Ship Investment Synchronicity"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis of Korean Shipping Companies\u2019 Ship Investment Synchronicity"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc774\ud0dc\ud718(\uacbd\ub0a8\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uace0\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uc758 \ud0c0\uc774\ubc0d\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf4\uace0 \ub610\ud55c \ub2e4\uac00\uc624\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4 \ud638\ud669\uae30\uc5d0 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc120\uc8fc\uc758 \uc2e0\uc911\ud55c \uc120\ubc15 \ubc1c\uc8fc\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790 \ub3d9\uc870\ud654 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \uacc4\ub7c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc6b4\uc774 \ub0a8\uc131\ud574\uc6b4, SK\ud574\uc6b4, \uc720\ucf54\uce74\uce90\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc2a4, \uc7a5\uae08\uc0c1\uc120, \ucc9c\uacbd\ud574, \ud55c\uc9c4\ud574\uc6b4\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 0.6~0.9 \uc0ac\uc774\uc774\uba70 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud328\ud134\uc774 \ub3d9\uc870\ud654\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4.

It finds that synthetic resin and fine chemical material have declined from star to cash cow, while flat-rolled steel and synthetic rubber upgraded from cash cow to star. Car has risen upward from dog to child but rubber products remain dogs. The results of the static spatial shift-share analysis also indicate that the positive share effect of national absolute export growth is more for Gwangyang than Incheon, Busan and Pyeongtaek. However, dynamic analysis indicates the shift effect(region-neighbor sectoral effect) is either negative or the positive effect is dwindling, accounting for weak regional competitiveness. Since national effect is negative and associated with the negative region-neighbor sectoral effect for rubber products, Gwangyang is losing regional competitiveness despite favorable share effects. Given the export decline over 2010-2017, most products exhibit a negative shift alongside a positive national effect, and export growth owing to national effects is negated by export loss because of the region-neighbor sectoral effect."}]},"fpage":"397","lpage":"411","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.3.397","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002386863","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"09","volume":"34","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002386862","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c \uc218\ucd9c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub958\ube44 \ubcf4\uc870\uae08\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The effects of export logistics cost subsidies on the exports in the Korean agricultural industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The effects of export logistics cost subsidies on the exports in the Korean agricultural industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uacfd\uc810\uc2dd(\ucda9\uccad\ub0a8\ub3c4 \ub18d\uc815\uad6d \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c\uc720\ud1b5\uacfc \uc8fc\ubb34\uad00)","\uc7a5\ub9bc(\uc911\uad6d \uac15\uc11c\uc7ac\uacbd\uc7ac\ud559 \uad50\uc218)","\uc624\uadfc\uc5fd(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uae09\ub418\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\ube44 \ubcf4\uc870\uae08\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811 \uc9c0\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ubcf4\uc870\uae08\uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \uc218\ucd9c\ub18d\ubbfc\ub4e4\uc758 \uc785\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ud638\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ubc29\ubc95\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc WTO \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud3d0\uc9c0\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\ubcf4\uc870\uae08\uc744 \ud3d0\uc9c0\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0a0 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \ubb3c\ub958\ube44 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uae30\uc900, \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud604\ud669, \uc218\ucd9c\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubd84\uc11d \ub4f1\uc744 \ud589\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\ubcf4\uc870\uae08\uc774 \uc218\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc911\uc559\uc815\ubd80\uc758 \ubcf4\uc870\uae08\ub9cc\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub358 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub4e4\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc9c0\uc790\uccb4\ub4e4\uc758 \ubcf4\uc870\uae08 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.\\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \uc2e4\uc81c\ub85c \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\ubcf4\uc870\uae08\uc740 \uc218\ucd9c \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud574\uc654\uc73c\uba70 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc77c\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \ud3d0\uc9c0\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc218\ucd9c\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uac00\uaca9\uc0c1\uc2b9\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ucd9c\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ud558\ub77d\uc2dc\ud0ac \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ubc88 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\ube44 \ubcf4\uc870 \ud3d0\uc9c0\ub294 \ud53c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc774\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uacc4\uae30\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc218\ucd9c\ub18d\uc5c5 \uc721\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc1c\uad74\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub178\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Korean government has been providing subsidies to the farmers exporting their produce under the scheme of export logistics cost subsidies program. However, in December 2015, the members of the World Trade Organization reached an agreement known as the \u201cNairobi Package,\u201d which requires signatory governments to bring to an immediate standstill and, then, phase out their agricultural export subsidies. Developing countries, including Korea, have to phase out their export subsidies by the end of 2018. This paper investigates the effects of agricultural subsidies by using the recent data on subsidies and exports. We used regression analysis based on a gravity equation to find the relationship between agricultural subsidies and export performance. We found that subsidies have a deep impact on the export of agricultural goods by Korea. This seems to imply that the withdrawal of subsidies may reduce the agricultural export volume. Therefore, we need to draft policies that minimize the harmful effects of the discontinuation of subsidies."}]},"fpage":"377","lpage":"395","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.3.377","uci":null,"citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002386862","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"09","volume":"34","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002386861","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc9c1\uac70\ub798 \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ud488\uc9c8\uce21\uc815\uc694\uc778 \ub3c4\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c; \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Extracting Factors of Logistics Service Quality of B2C Transactions in Agricultural Products"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Extracting Factors of Logistics Service Quality of B2C Transactions in Agricultural Products"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ud61c\uc9c4(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucd5c\uadfc \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c\uc758 B2C \uc9c1\uac70\ub798\ub294 \ube60\ub974\uac8c \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305 \ubc0f \uad6c\ub9e4\ucc44\ub110\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c \uac70\ub798\uc2dc \ud310\ub9e4\uc790\ub294 \uc218\uc694\uc790 \ud655\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub294\ub370, \uc774\ub294 \uc218\uc694\uc790\uc758 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uac70\ub798\uc2dc \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc9c8\uacfc \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc9c1\uc811\ud310\ub9e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub4dc\ubb38 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694\uc778\uacfc \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uc9c1\uac70\ub798 \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ud488\uc9c8 \uce21\uc815\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uce21\uc815\uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \u2018\uac70\ub798 \uc804\u2019, \u2018\uac70\ub798 \ud6c4\u2019, \u2018\uc8fc\ubb38\ubd88\uc77c\uce58 \ucc98\ub9ac\u2019\uac00 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 20\uac1c\uc758 \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc18c\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"B2C transactions of agricultural products are growing very fast and is becoming an important marketing and purchasing channels.

The chemical tanker\u2019s hull is specially designed for the shipment of a wide range of target cargoes with various characteristics such as toxicality, explosiveness, flammability, and corrosiveness. Despite this specificity, hipping market analysis of chemical tankers, similar to that of general bulk ships is based on the shipping rate, ship price, and other relevant variables of a standard ship size.\\nThis study analyzes some major determinants of global chemical tankers freight rates using a vector error correction model.

Although many previous studies have analyzed container and dry bulk markets, only a few have carried out the dynamic analysis of chemical tanker market. This study is meaningful because it explains the dynamic characteristics of the chemical tanker market, using a vector error correction model."}]},"fpage":"251","lpage":"269","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.34.2.251","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002359823","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"06","volume":"34","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002359816","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucd5c\uadfc \ud574\uc6b4\ub3d9\ub9f9\uc758 \uc804\uac1c\uc640 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud2b9\uc9d5 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\uc758 \ub300\uc751 \ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Evaluation of Current Trends in the Global Liner Conference and Future Direction of South Korea\u2019s Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Evaluation of Current Trends in the Global Liner Conference and Future Direction of South Korea\u2019s Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc815\uc7ac\uc6b0(\uacbd\uc778\uc5ec\uc790\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \ucd94\uc9c4\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\ub3d9\ub9f9\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud574\uc11c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ud574\uc6b4\ub3d9\ub9f9\uc758 \ud655\uc0b0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \ub300\uc751\ucc45\uc744 \uac00\uc838\uc57c \ub418\ub294\uc9c0 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c \uccab\uc9f8, \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\uc720\ub7fd \ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0\ub294 \uc720\ub7fd\uacc4 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ubc30\ub825\uc774 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\ub294 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\ubbf8\uc8fc \ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc65c\ub0d0\ud558\uba74 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc740 \ubbf8\uad6d \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc218\uc2ec\uacfc \ud758\uc218, \ud30c\ub098\ub9c8 \uc6b4\ud558 \ud1b5\uacfc \uc5ec\ubd80 \ub4f1 \uae30\uc874 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc778\ud504\ub77c \ubb38\uc81c \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ucd08\ub300\ud615 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ud22c\uc785\uc774 \uc27d\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc120\uc0ac\uac00 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud560 \uc5ec\uc9c0\uac00 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc678\uad6d \ud604\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc804\uc6a9\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba74 \ub2e4\ub978 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uadf8\ub9cc\ud07c \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ud558\uc5ed \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc7a5\ubc1b\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ud574\uc6b4\ub3d9\ub9f9 \uccb4\uacb0\uc2dc \uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \ud655\uc778\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\uc720\ub7fd \ud56d\ub85c\ub098 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\ubbf8\uc8fc \ud56d\ub85c\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ud55c-\ub3d9\ub0a8\uc544 \ud56d\ub85c, \ud55c-\uc77c \ubc0f \ud55c-\uc911 \ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \ub2e4\ub978 \ub098\ub77c\uc758 \uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uacfc \uc120\ubc15\uacf5\uc720\ud611\uc815\uacfc \uc2ac\ub86f\uc6a9\uc120\uc744 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uccb4\uacb0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this article is to ascertain the implications of changes in liner alliance.

Finally, I would like to present some concluding insights for the decision makers at liner shipping companies to help them in determining their own strategies for the future liner shipping market. The result as follows.\\nThe first, Because of the strength of EU\u2019s shipping companies on the route of European-Far east such as Maersk, MSC, CMA-CGM, Hapag-Lloyd through the fast growth of Very Large Container Ships, South Korea\u2019s shipping companies more concentrate on the transpacific trade route than Europe-Far East and transatlantic trade routes..\\nThe second, because shipping companies have been involved in container terminal operations for the sack of controlling their business, South Korea\u2019s shipping companies should confirm whether current and future members of the

An extensive survey was conducted in Incheon Port to recognize factors that affect port logistics services from the perspective of two direct stakeholder groups, shippers and port service providers, and an indirect stakeholder group, public agencies, by considering their roles in port operations. According to the results of AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process), shippers, port service providers, and public agencies consider service level (0.420), cost (0.251), and reliability and awareness (0.371) as the most important factors, clearly indicating their different perceptions.

Specifically, the coefficients of the four explanatory variables show strong impact on the BDI index. The VEC model reveals that all four variables have zero p-value. This means that the estimated result of the regression is statistically significant.

Estimating the long-run equilibrium relationship and error correction models identified that the influence of income variables on fishery products was larger for exports than for imports. This suggests that if the global economy is stable, then continuous export growth is possible. Through the coefficient of the real effective exchange rate, which is a price variable, this study confirms that exchange rate stability can directly and positively affect the trade balance of fishery products. In addition, the effect of the rise in export unit prices in the export function had a positive effect on exports and a negative effect on increase in fishery products\u2019 export in China. Additionally, global carbon dioxide emission had a negative impact on Korean fishery products\u2019 import.

Therefore this study conducted origin-destination(O-D) analysis of E-commerce cargo between Korea ad China carried by car-ferry transportation. In addition, an interview study was undertaken to obtain contents validity of the results of the O-D analysis. The import documents of forwarding companies which handle E-commerce cargoes using Weidong Ferry were used for the O-D analysis based on maritime transportation.\\nThe results are as followa: Digital/home appliance products are the main products while the main O-D route is from Shandong province to Gyeonggi province. The interviews suggest that car-ferry transportation is competitive for cargoes weighing more than 5kg by 40% than air transportation. A new market for this service can be between Weihai in Shandong province and Gyeonggi province as both car-ferry and container services are available.

Considering the importance of the shipping industry to the Korean economy, the early identification of a crisis in an individual shipping company is essential, to establish a default prediction method that will facilitate preparing necessary countermeasures. The purpose of this study is to develop a crisis diagnosis and prediction model that deals with repetitive crises in shipping companies, and presents a long-term management direction. The Logit Model was used to predict defaults in shipping companies. This study compared default probabilities of companies filing for legal management. The results show that the model\u2019s estimated default probability sent crisis signals to those companies before they filed for court receivership. This confirmed the study\u2019s models could help shipping companies predict possible failure, which lays the foundation for the risk management of Korean shipping companies in an uncertain global market.

This study employs the traditional shift-share analysis to investigate the nature of import change, and uses shift-share analysis with spatial structure to distinguish between two different spatial effects: the regional competitive effect and the neighborhood influence. The traditional shift-share analysis shows that Daesan Port has a high regional competitiveness for crude petroleum and basic petrochemical, but an unfavorable regional share effect for petroleum articles. The spatial shift-share analysis indicates that, for crude petroleum, Daesan Port has a competitive advantage over Yeosu and Ulsan Ports, but a competitive disadvantage over Incheon Port. For petroleum products, the competitiveness of Daesan Port lags behind Yeosu, Ulsan, Pyungtaek, Busan, and Incheon Ports. This study also shows that the competitiveness is indeterminate compared to Ulsan and Yeosu Ports for basic petrochemicals."}]},"fpage":"769","lpage":"784","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.33.4.769","uci":null,"citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002300190","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2018","pub-mon":"01","volume":"33","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002300188","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc11c\ud574\uc548\uad8c \ubc8c\ud06c\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c : \uc778\ucc9c, \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4, \uad70\uc0b0\ud56d\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Concentration of Bulk Cargoes on the West Coast: An Analysis Focused on the Incheon, Pyeongtaek-Dangjin, and Gunsan Ports"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Concentration of Bulk Cargoes on the West Coast: An Analysis Focused on the Incheon, Pyeongtaek-Dangjin, and Gunsan Ports"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uacf5\uc815\ubbfc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\ub0a8\ud0dc\ud604(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc811\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc \uac04\uc5d0\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5 \uc911\ubcf5\uacfc, \uacfc\ub3c4\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc800\ud558 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uad8c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc778 \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d, \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d, \uad70\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud654\uc885\uc778 \uc591\uace1, \ubaa9\uc7ac, \ucca0\uc7ac \ud654\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ubcc0\uc774-\ud560\ub2f9\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4\uc640 \ud56d\ub9cc \uacbd\uc7c1\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc5f0\uad6c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d, \ubcc0\uc774-\ud560\ub2f9 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc9c0\ub2c8\uacc4\uc218\uc640 \ub85c\ub80c\uce20\uace1\uc120\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc591\uace1\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 2007\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2010\ub144 \uae4c\uc9c0 \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\ub098, 2010\ub144 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\uba70 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud654\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc758 \uc591\uace1 \ucc98\ub9ac \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud588\uace0, \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc758 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc774 \ud558\ub77d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubaa9\uc7ac\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4\ub294 \uc591\uace1\ud654\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub192\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \ubcc0\uc774\ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc774 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc783\ub2e4\uac00 2014\ub144 \uc774\ud6c4 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud68c\ubcf5\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ucca0\uc7ac\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubaa9\uc7ac\ud654\ubb3c\uacfc \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c \uc9d1\uc911\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uc9c0\ub294 \uc54a\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uad70\uc0b0\ud56d\uc774 \uafb8\uc900\ud558\uac8c \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud68d\ub4dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study examined the concentration of bulk cargoes and the competition between ports by analyzing port concentration through the HHI and the Gini Index.

The concentration of grain cargoes was high over the period 2007\u20132010, but decreased drastically after the cargo volume was dispersed in 2010.

Freight has high volatility that affects a vessel\u2019s price. To manage risks underlying within the dry bulk market, the interaction between freight and vessel\u2019s price has to be come across in the sense of vessel\u2019s lifecycle. This study uses empirical examinations, like cross correlation analysis, co-integration test, granger causality test and impulse response analysis to derive meaningful relationships from time serial law data. Results revealed a sequential time lag between freight and vessel lifecycle, and a long-term relationship between freight, and prices of new-builds and second-hand vessels. The granger causality analysis revealed a causal relationship between freight and vessel price. The impulse response analysis demonstrated that freight impact is positive for three to four months. Based on these results, this study provides insights to manage volatility, throughout vessel lifecycles from new-build to demolition, in the dry bulk market."}]},"fpage":"703","lpage":"727","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2018.33.4.703","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002300185","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"10","volume":"33","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002270156","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub3d9\ud574\xb7\ubb35\ud638\ud56d\uc758 \ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc911\uc2ec\uc9c0 \uad6c\ucd95 \ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \u2013\uae30\uc885\uc810(OD)\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Strategy to Establish Regional Hub for Northern Logistics on Donghae-Mukho Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Strategy to Establish Regional Hub for Northern Logistics on Donghae-Mukho Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uac15\ub2ec\uc6d0(\ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc13c\ud130)","\uc2ec\uaddc\uc5b8(\ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc13c\ud130)","\ubbfc\uc138\ud64d(\ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc13c\ud130)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uac15\uc6d0\ub3c4 \ub0b4 \ud658\ub3d9\ud574\uad8c \ubb3c\ub958\uc911\uc2ec\uc9c0\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub3d9\ud574\xb7\ubb35\ud638\ud56d\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\ub294 \ubcf5\ud569\ubb3c\ub958\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud0c0\uae43 \uc9c0\uc5ed \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 OD\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\uc778\uac00\ub2a5\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud0c0\uae43 \uc9c0\uc5ed \uc218\ucd9c\uc785 \uc5c5\uccb4\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\ud574\xb7\ubb35\ud638\ud56d\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0, \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud0c0\uae43 \ud488\ubaa9\uad70\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958 \uc911\uc2ec\uc9c0 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569\ubb3c\ub958\ud56d \uc804\ud658 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \ub3d9\ud574\xb7\ubb35\ud638\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc778 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc740 102,428 TEU\uc774\uba70, \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \ube44\uae08\uc18d\uacfc \uadf8 \uc81c\ud488, \ucc28\ub7c9\xb7\ud56d\uacf5\uae30\xb7\uc120\ubc15, \uc870\uc81c \uc2dd\ub8cc\ud488, \ud384\ud504\xb7\uc885\uc774 \ud488\ubaa9\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc810\uc720\uc728\uc744 \ub192\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\ud488\ubaa9\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc124\ubb38 \uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc Port Sales, \ud56d\ub85c \uc99d\ub300, \ubc30\ud6c4\uad50\ud1b5\ub9dd\ud655\ucda9 \ub4f1\uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub3d9\ud574\xb7\ubb35\ud638\ud56d \ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc911\uc2ec\uc9c0 \uad6c\ucd95\ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub85c\uac1c\uc124, \uc778\ud504\ub77c\ud655\ucda9, \uad50\ud1b5\ub9dd\uac1c\uc120, \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305\uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The development of the Fan East-Sea necessitates the revitalization of the Donghae-Mukho port as a Fan East-Sea logistics hub within Gangwon-do.

Therefore, we conducted an origin-destination analysis, portfolio analysis and a questionnaire survey on the target area. We found that the capacity of containers, which the port can hold is 102,428 TEU. The portfolio analysis reveals that items such as non-metals and their products, vehicles/aircrafts/vessels, groceries and pulp/paper should be selected as strategic products, which could facilitate continuous growth in the market shares. Futhermore, the survey results demonstrate port sales, increased usage of the sea- route, and expansion of the transportation network as the current issues.

The Shipping Investment Company (Korean version of German K/G) lost its function of funding in the shipping finance market.

The analysis result showed that the average CCR Model efficiency of domestic terminal operators is 0.702, average BCC Model efficiency of them is 0.856 and the average efficiency of scale is 0.837. In Malmquist analysis result, it showed that average index is 0.946. Consequentially, GTO are relatively better than other terminal operators in terms of efficiency and productivity. Going forward, to foster and revitalize the domestic terminal industry, it will be necessary for prospective terminal operators to actively introduce the advanced operational methods of GTO, and reduce excessive competition by integrating domestic terminal operators."}]},"fpage":"555","lpage":"575","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.3.555","uci":null,"citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002270143","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"08","volume":"33","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002256845","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc678\uad6d\uacc4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654 \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Empirical Analysis of Efficiency and Productivity Change in the Korean Freight Forwarding Industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Empirical Analysis of Efficiency and Productivity Change in the Korean Freight Forwarding Industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud669\uacbd\uc5f0(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ud669\uc815\ud604(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Sequential Malmquist \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc678\uad6d\uacc4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6d\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc678\uad6d\uacc4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4 22\uac1c\uc758 \uc7ac\ubb34\uc81c\ud45c \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c Sequential Malmquist \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c 2011\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2016\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 6\ub144\uac04 \uc804\uccb4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 6.0% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, \uae30\uc220\uc740 \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 6.0% \uc9c4\ubcf4\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 Sequential Malmquist \uc9c0\uc218\ub294 1.00\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uae30\uc5c5 \uacc4\uc5f4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 7.02% \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, \uc678\uad6d\uacc4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 4.95% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, 3PL \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \uc5f0\ud3c9\uade0 0.73% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \ubc0f \uc678\uad6d\uacc4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in efficiency and productivity in the Korean freight forwarding industry for the period 2011-2016.

This study analyzes the impacts and ripple effects of large-, medium-, and small-sized freight vehicles. In addition, it provides suggestions on their policy implications. The results provide that the influence of the monitoring standards of the freight vehicle supply policy and transfer restriction of the freight vehicle policy directly affect medium- and small-sized freight vehicles rather than the large-sized freight vehicles. This phenomenon confirms that the medium- and small-sized freight vehicles could be a limiting factor.

Considering the development of the Chinese economy, global logistics companies are attempting to enter China, with competition in the industry remarkably increasing. A number of systematic logistics services are emphasized to meet customer needs in the Chinese market. This study aims to investigate the various determinants of customer satisfaction relevant to logistics services. Based on theoretical foundations and previous studies, this study provides nine hypotheses using primary data to empirically verify the hypotheses. A survey was conducted on Chinese companies using international logistics services. According to empirical findings, informative and economic services play an important role in improving customer satisfaction of logistics services. In addition, human, financial, and geographical resources are important in logistics services.

Furthermore, the measurement of productivity change through the Malmquist model demonstrated the following outcomes: the average productivity change of the seven Chinese shipping companies during the period 2009 to 2015 was 1.064, which represented an annual productivity increase of 6.4%; the average productivity change of the four Korean shipping companies was 1.075, increasing at 7.5% annually; and the average productivity change of the four Japanese shipping companies was 1.066, increasing at 6.6% annually."}]},"fpage":"411","lpage":"432","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33..411","uci":null,"citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002256828","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"07","volume":"33","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002237651","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\ud654\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c -\uad6d\uc81c \uc120\uc6a9\ud488 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Electronic Commerce of the Port Logistics Industry: Study of the International Ship Supply Business"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Electronic Commerce of the Port Logistics Industry: Study of the International Ship Supply Business"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc774\ud64d\uac78(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc5ed \uad6d\uc81c\uc120\uc6a9\ud488 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc9c1\ubb34\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ucde8\uc57d\uc810\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uad6d\uac00 \uc9c1\ubb34\ub2a5\ub825 \ud45c\uc900\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud558\uc5ec 3\uac00\uc9c0 \ud3c9\uac00\uc601\uc5ed\uacfc 29\uac00\uc9c0 \uc138\ubd80\ud3c9\uac00\ud56d\ubaa9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \uc9c1\ubb34 \ud3c9\uac00\uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0, \ubd80\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc5ed \uc120\uc6a9\ud488 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d \uc870\uc0ac \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c IPA\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ub300\ube44 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc218\ud589 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc758 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc218\ud589\uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc774 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \uc218\uc900\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd80\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \uc120\uc6a9\ud488 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\ud654\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc9c1\ubb34 \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\ub294 \uace0\uac1d\uc758 \ud3b8\uc758\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubd80\uc218\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8 \uac1c\uc124\uacfc \uc720\uc9c0\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub098, \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc744 \ud655\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\ub294 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubd80\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc5ed \uad6d\uc81c \uc120\uc6a9\ud488 \uacf5\uae09\uc5c5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc220\uc801 \uce21\uba74\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uae30\uc874 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \uc7ac\uc124\uacc4\uac00 \uc120\ud589\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\ub8cc\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study aims to present some implications for electronic commerce(EC) in the international ship supply business at Busan port.

Busan Port has maintained stable rates of change of transshipment cargo compared to export and import cargo, it is necessary to identify the dynamic structural relationship of ports that have high and long-term contributions to transshipment cargo at Busan Port. The study analyzed the dynamic structure relationship by establishing a vector error correction model for ports with high contributions. Among the target ports for Busan Port, Ningbo can be relatively explained the most, and the target ports can be somewhat explained by Dalian. Such results on effect and efficiency can become priority criteria for evaluating risk levels for port marketing and determining target ports. As a result of variance decomposition analysis, dependency of the target ports to handle transshipment cargo at Busan Port can be quantitatively reviewed; various attraction strategies can be developed through this according to their dependency."}]},"fpage":"339","lpage":"354","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.2.339","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002237649","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"07","volume":"33","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002237648","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd \ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Smart supply chain management: Strategy derived using AHP"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Smart supply chain management: Strategy derived using AHP"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc2e0\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc81c4\ucc28 \ud601\uba85\uc2dc\ub300\ub294 \ucd08\uc5f0\uacb0\uc0ac\ud68c(Hyper-connected Society)\ub85c \uc778\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0 \uc131\uc7a5 \ub3d9\ub825\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc774 \ud615\uc131\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc0ac\ubb3c\uc778\ud130\ub137(IoT; Internet of Things)\uc740 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ubb3c\ub958\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ube45\ub370\uc774\ud0c0\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud0c0\ub97c \uc5bb\uace0 \uc774\ud574\ud558\uba70 \ucc98\ub9ac\ud558\uace0 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud558\uba70 \uc785\uccb4\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc804\ub2ec\ud558\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc9c0\ub2a5\ud615 \ubd84\uc11d\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uc790\uae30 \ub9de\ucda4\ud615 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc138\ubd84\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ud45c\uc900\ud654\ub294 \uc6a9\uc774\uc131\uacfc \uac1c\ubc29\uc131 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uae09\uc18d\ud558\uac8c \uc9c4\ud654\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub137\uc9f8, \ubb3c\ub958\ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc7a5\uc560\uac00 \ub420 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubb3c\ub958\ubcf4\uc548\uc740 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131 \ud655\ubcf4\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uc6b0\uc120 \uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\uba70 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\ub294 \uc6b0\ubc84\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\ub959 \ub3c4\uc2dc\ubb3c\ub958 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ub354\uc6b1 \uac15\ud654\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5b4 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2a4\ub9c8\ud2b8\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Fourth Neo Industrial Revolution is related to a hyper-connected society with regards to artificial intelligence, printed electronics tags, and 3D printing technology, all of which have been gaining momentum as new growth engines.

First, logistics big data requires implemented procedures to better understand collected data and a systemized analytic capability to utilize refined data. Second, an intelligent analysis system and a tailored user-based system depending on segmentation and differentiated strategic decision-making capability are required. Third, based on availability and openness, standardization will grow rapidly, and with simplification as a catalyst, the speed of technology development will be accelerated.

The optimum location was required to provide a synergy effect with a combined function between the main facility, the warehouse facilities, and customs clearance and inspection facilities, along with key product items transportation between Korea and China."}]},"fpage":"277","lpage":"298","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.2.277","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002237646","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"07","volume":"33","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002237645","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735\ub300\ucd9c\uc758 \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Determinants of shipping bank loan spreads: An empirical study"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Determinants of shipping bank loan spreads: An empirical study"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uac15\ubcd1\ud0dc(\ud55c\uad6d\ubb34\uc5ed\ubcf4\ud5d8\uacf5\uc0ac)","\uc774\uae30\ud658(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uba85\ud76c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735\ub300\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc740 \ub300\ucd9c\uc740\ud589\uc740 \ubb3c\ub860 \ucc28\uc8fc\uc5d0\uac8c\ub3c4 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc774\uc288\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2010\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2016\ub144 \uc0ac\uc774\uc5d0 \uc2e4\ud589\ub41c 66\uac74\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735\ub300\ucd9c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc740\ud589\uc758 \uc790\uae08\uc870\ub2ec\ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8\ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\uc5c4 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc774 \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubaa8\ub378\ubcc4 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uc804\uccb4 \uc120\uc885\uacfc \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc740\ud589\uc758 \uc790\uae08\uc870\ub2ec\ube44\uc6a9\uacfc \ucc28\uc8fc\uc758 \uc2dc\uc7a5\ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \ub178\ucd9c\uc815\ub3c4\uac00 \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc740\ud589\uc758 \uc790\uae08\uc870\ub2ec\ube44\uc6a9\ub9cc\uc774 \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 CDS\ud504\ub9ac\ubbf8\uc5c4, LTV, \ub300\ucd9c\uae30\uac04, \ub300\ucd9c\uae08\uc561, \uc774\uc775\uc758 \uc5f0\uc18d\uae30\uac04, ROA, \ub808\ubc84\ub9ac\uc9c0\ube44\uc728, \ucc28\uc8fc\uc758 \uc5c5\ub825, ClarkSea Index, MSCI Index \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc720\uc758\ubbf8\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \ub3d9 \ubd84\uc11d\ubaa8\ud615\uc740 \uc740\ud589\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735 \uac00\uc0b0\uae08\ub9ac \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uac8c \uc801\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Bank loan interest rates are determined by funding and administrative costs, default risk premium, and return on capital. However, in the case of ship financing, the determinants differ due to the characteristics of relationship banking and the unique lending structure, where there is high fluctuation in the value of a vessel as collateral. We analyzed 66 shipping bank loans signed between 2010 and 2015 to identify the impact level of 5 explanatory variable groups on loan spread: funding cost of banks, characteristics of collateral, financial characteristics, credit worthiness of borrowers, and level of market risk exposure. We identified that bank funding cost and market risk exposure were determinant factors of shipping bank loan spreads for container ships, but for tankers, only funding cost of banks was identified as a significant determinant. Such an outcome is considerable due to the characteristics of the tanker market, which includes separate markets for each type of tanker, competitive market conditions, and different vessel operations."}]},"fpage":"253","lpage":"275","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.2.253","uci":null,"citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002237645","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"03","volume":"33","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002207529","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc218\ub3c4\uad8c \uc784\ub300 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc785\uc8fc \uc120\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Selection Factors of Rental Logistics Centers in Capital Areas"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Selection Factors of Rental Logistics Centers in Capital Areas"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc7ac\ud638(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc724\uc815\ud638(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc804\uad6d \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 40% \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 \uc218\ub3c4\uad8c\uc5d0 \uc9d1\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc784\ub300 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc785\uc8fc\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ub418\ub294 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc0c1\uc704\uacc4\uce35 \ub300\uc694\uc778\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \ube44\uc6a9\uc694\uc778\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\uace0, \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc694\uc778, \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc694\uc778 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ubc1b\uc558\ub2e4. \ud558\uc704\uacc4\uce35 \uc18c\uc694\uc778\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc784\ub300\ub8cc\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc13c\ud130\uc6b4\uc601\uc2dc\uc124 \ud22c\uc790\ube44\uc6a9, \uc778\uac74\ube44, \uc13c\ud130\uc124\ube44 \uad00\ub9ac\ube44, \ucc28\ub7c9 \uc218\uc6a9\ub825, \ubcf4\uc548 \ubc0f \uc548\uc804\uc124\ube44 \uc124\uce58\uc720\ubb34, \uc778\ub825 \ucd9c\uc6d0\uc5ec\ubd80, \ud3b8\uc758\uc2dc\uc124 \uc811\uadfc\uc131, \uacf5\ud56d \ubc0f \ud56d\ub9cc \uc811\uadfc\uc131, \uace0\uc18d\ub3c4\ub85c \uc811\uadfc\uc131, \uc601\uc5c5 \ud655\uc7a5\uc131 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5c5\uc885\uc758 \ud654\uc8fc\ub4e4\uacfc \uc784\ucc28\uc778\uc744 \uc720\uce58\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc5c5\uccb4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc785\uc8fc \ud639\uc740 \uc784\ub300\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694\uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294\ub370 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Since at least 40% of logistics centers are concentrated in capital areas, the present study aims to analyze the importance levels of the selection factors of some rental logistics centers in capital areas by utilizing AHP.

This study analyzes fresh food items relates to cold chain that were exchanged between China and Gwangyang Port from 2000 to 2014. For the analysis of this study, the data among 32 items classified by SPIDC were limited to meat, fish and shellfish; other animal or vegetable prepared foods; and beverages related to cold chain. This study predicted the cold chain trade volume by applying the ARIMA model, with a high prediction power, using SPSS. The ARIMA model is integrated and used in prediction studies to convert unstable time series into stable time series. To use the model, the mean and variance should be constant and the covariance should be according to the time difference. The results of the study are as follows.

In response to the 2014 Sewol car ferry disaster, the Korean government proposed a new flexible tariff of different rates between weekdays and weekends set to commence in 2015. The proposal faced opposition from island residents who feared potential diminution of passenger as a result of the rate increase. By collecting panel dataset on 47 commercial passenger shipping routes, the present paper can clarify the relationship between demand and dependent variables such as price. This study divides the 47 routes into two groups based on their medium passenger number: the routes which serve 260,000 and above, and the routes transporting below 260,000 people. Due to positive effects from GDP growth in Korea, the routes which serve 260,000 and above show the price elasticity of demand to be -0.12 and the GDP elasticity of demand to be +1.5. Therefore even after the Sewol disaster, this study forecasts a continual growth of demand in the short-term."}]},"fpage":"179","lpage":"199","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.1.179","uci":"G704-000463.2017.33.1.004","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002207527","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"03","volume":"33","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002207526","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc2dc\ucc28\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c\uad6c\uc870 \ubd84\uc11d: \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Growth-Rate Differential Analysis of Export Structure: The Case of Gwangyang and Incheon Ports"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Growth-Rate Differential Analysis of Export Structure: The Case of Gwangyang and Incheon Ports"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubaa8\uc218\uc6d0(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc815\ud64d\uc601(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uad11\ubc30(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8\uace0\ub294 \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc758 10\uac1c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc218\ucd9c\ud488\ubaa9\uc758 \uc911\ub7c9\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\uc774\ud560\ub2f9\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc2dc\ucc28\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\ucd9c\ubcc0\ub3d9\uc744 \uc694\uc778\ubcc4\ub85c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \ubcc0\uc774\ud560\ub2f9\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 10\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9 \uc911 9\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud560\ub2f9\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc591\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\ub098 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc2dc\ucc28\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ud488\ubaa9\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc694\uc778\uc774 \uc74c\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\ub97c \uac00\uc838 \ub450 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc0c1\ubc18\ub41c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc784\uc744 \ubc1d\ud78c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcc0\uc774\ud560\ub2f9\ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uad6c\uc870\ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud560\ub2f9\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc591\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\ub97c \uac16\ub294 6\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9 \uc911 1\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9\ub9cc \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc2dc\ucc28\ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uc694\uc778\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc694\uc778\uc774 \uc591\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\uc774\uba70 \ub098\uba38\uc9c0 5\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc6b0\uc704\uac00 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc758 \ubcc0\uc774\ud560\ub2f9\ubd84\uc11d\uc740 3\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0b0\uc5c5\uad6c\uc870\ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ud560\ub2f9\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc591\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\ub098 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc2dc\ucc28\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac00\uc911\uc694\uc778\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc694\uc778\uc774 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc591\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\ub97c \uac16\ub294 \ud488\ubaa9\uc774 \uc5c6\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc218\ucd9c\uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\ud574\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub450 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \uc801\uc6a9\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study empirically examines the 10 export sectors in Gwangyang and Incheon Ports.

The signs of steel flate-rolled products, fine chemical material, synthetic rubber, favorite food and other metal ores are positive for industry-mix as well as regional shift effect. Their competitive advantage, however, tends to decline. The items such as fine chemical material and other metal ores have favorable structure at national level but are unfavorable at regional one.

Second, we set up a model to test the route specialization by using a dummy variable. As a result of estimation, CCFI and bunker price exerted statistically significant impacts on the profit ratios with positive and negative sign respectively. Although the dummy variable carries a positive sign, it is not statistically significant. However the effects of charter-in ratio and TEU-owned are obscure. In conclusion, it is necessary for policy makers to review the shipping policies toward the intra-Asian shipping market to constrain the destructive competition prevailing in the global shipping market and to enhance cooperation between the shipping companies operating intra-Asia and those operating globally."}]},"fpage":"143","lpage":"161","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.1.143","uci":"G704-000463.2017.33.1.008","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002207525","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"03","volume":"33","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002207524","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ud574\uc6a9\uc120\uacc4\uc57d\uc0c1 FIOST \uc870\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778 \uc758\ubb34\uc758 \uc704\ubc18\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c -Eems Solar\ud638 \uc0ac\uac74\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Breach of Carrier\'s Duty by FIOST Clause under Voyage Charterparty: Focus on the Eems Solar Case"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Breach of Carrier\'s Duty by FIOST Clause under Voyage Charterparty: Focus on the Eems Solar Case"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud55c\ub099\ud604(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\uc9c0\ubb38(\uad6d\uc81c\uc6d0\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc815\ubcf4\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Eems Solar\ud638 \uc0ac\uac74\uc740 FIOST \uc870\ud56d\uacfc \uc801\ubd80\ubd88\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc7c1\uc810\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub358 \uc0ac\uc548\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc0ac\uac74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud53c\uace0\ub294 \uc6a9\uc120\uacc4\uc57d\uc0c1\uc758 \uc120\uc8fc\uc774\uba70, \ud574\ub2f9 \uc6a9\uc120\uacc4\uc57d\uc740 \uc774 \uc870\ud56d\uc744 \ud3b8\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6a9\uc120\uacc4\uc57d\uc774 \ud3b8\uc785\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc774 \ubc1c\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \uadf8 \ucd5c\uc885\uc18c\uc9c0\uc778\uc740 \uc6d0\uace0\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc0ac\uac74\ud310\uacb0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774 \uc870\ud56d\uc774 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \ud3b8\uc785\ub41c \uac83\uc774 \uc778\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774 \uc870\ud56d\uc758 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc801\uc6a9\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \uc7c1\uc810\uc774 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7f0\ub370 \uc774 \uc870\ud56d\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uacfc \uc801\uc6a9\ubc94\uc704 \ub4f1\uc774 \uba85\ud655\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc544 \uc2e4\ubb34\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc774 \uc870\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \ud574\uacb0\uc744 \uc8fc\uc800\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uacc4\uc57d\ucc45\uc784 \ubc94\uc704 \ub4f1\uc758 \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774 \uc870\ud56d\uc758 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\xb7\uc9c0\uc704\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uac74\xb7\ud6a8\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\uba85\ud558\uac8c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Under the bill of lading that incorporates the FIOST terms of the charterparty, shippers, charterers, and consignees are to perform, supervise, and pay for loading, stowage, and discharge.

But if the debt level becomes higher, the cash flow from operating activities decreases. The decrease of after-tax cash flow will induce a higher risk of insolvency. This study analyzes the factors that influence the financial stability and that are likely to have a decisive impact on a company\'s survival and bankruptcy. It focuses on the relationship between the characteristics of the shipping companies and their financial soundness by using the data of the world\'s top 61 shipping companies from 2009 to 2013. Feasible Generalized Least square(FGLS) regression analyses are conducted for the empirical study using panel data. The study finds that the tangibility of assets of shipping firms is closely related to financial soundness. Shipping firms with higher tangible assets have easy recourse to debt, because vessels can serve as collateral. In addition, the study finds that the liquidity ratio of shipping firms is associated with financial stability. Current liabilities account for about 80% of the equity in shipping companies. Further, shipping companies are found to have low stability of the capital structure. Therefore, they need to restructure the organization to enhance their effectiveness and financial soundness."}]},"fpage":"85","lpage":"103","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2017.33.1.85","uci":"G704-000463.2017.33.1.007","citation-count":"11","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002207523","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2017","pub-mon":"03","volume":"33","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002207522","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc8fc\uc694 \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2e4\ud0dc\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of Information Service in Major International Passenger Terminals"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of Information Service in Major International Passenger Terminals"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ub958\uc7ac\uad00(\uc131\uade0\uad00\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\uc131\ub9cc(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ud64d\uac78(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0 \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574, \uc6f9 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubd84\uc11d, \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ubd84\uc11d, \uc6f9 \uc811\uadfc\uc131, \uc6f9 \uc131\ub2a5, \uc6f9-\ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud638\ud658\uc131\ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ubd80\uc0b0 \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc774 \uc778\ucc9c \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubbf8\ud761\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc774 \ub9ce\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ubd80\uc0b0\uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ucf58\ud150\uce20 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \ud3b8\uc758\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uac00 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uad6d\uc81c \uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc678\uad6d\uc778\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9 \ube48\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubd80\uc0b0 \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uacf5\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c2\uc678\uad6d\uc5b4 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c, \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uac70\uc758 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc6f9 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc774 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uacfc\uc758 \ud638\ud658\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uc911 \uc788\uac8c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc6f9 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub4e4\uc740 \ubaa8\ubc14\uc77c \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc801\ud569\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc774 \ub9ce\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \ubc1c\uacac\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\ucc45 \ub9c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc9c0\uc801\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this study is to analyze the actual status of information service offered by international passenger terminals.

In addition, recent socioeconomic changes in Korea such as its inclusion in a list of potential terrorist targets by Islamic State, the advancement of North Korea\u2019s nuclear weapons program, the Sewol ferry disaster, have prompted further review of SCS. In response, Korea has adopted the authorized economic operator(AEO) program. However, the rate of company participation to the AEO program is gradually shrinking. Therefore, this study aims to analyze whether the national SCS ecosystem is well formed and to determine methods to activate it. In particular, the study categorizes this ecosystem into government-private and company-company securities and uses game theory to analyze both.\\nThe government\u2013private security game deals with customs clearance of cargoes that is modeled according to queuing theory, while the interaction between government and the private sector is descried as a principal\u2013agent Stakelberg game. The outcomes of the game indicate that a scheme to overcome the differences of financial burden on private parties for AEO certification costs, according to the characteristics of their scales and types, is required. The study suggests two schemes. First, the AEO certification program should be expanded to include multiple companies as one unit, which can provide an advantage for small businesses as it would allow them to cooperate to overcome the security certification cost and demanding standards. Second, cooperation between customs-related authorities should be strengthened to provide a one-stop customs clearance with effective benefits for private sectors.\\nThe company\u2013company security game is a three-player game dealing with interactions between manufacturers, logistics providers, and terrorists. In this game, manufacturers and logistics providers attempt to ensure their security by minimizing expected loss, while terrorists strive to maximize the probability of successful attacks. Thus, the strategies of the supply chain against terrorist attacks can be considered in terms of distributed or centralized. The outcomes of the game are follows. First, a measure to overcome the relative terror vulnerability of logistics providers compared to manufacturers is required: A national specialized logistics security program is required in which most logistics providers can participate regardless of their size and type. Second, a policy should be framed to integrate security activities of the supply chain so as to minimize national security costs without adversely impacting national security.\\nThus, this study\u2019s significance is that it quantitatively shows that it is necessary to overcome the weakness of the current AEO program in order to vitalize the national SCS ecosystem, in accordance with the characteristics of business scale and type. In this way, the AEO program can encourage voluntary participation from private sector entities of various sizes and types, thereby enhancing the level of national security while minimizing related costs."}]},"fpage":"663","lpage":"688","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.4.663","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.4.005","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002176883","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"12","volume":"32","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002176879","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\uac00 \ud574\uc0c1\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc694\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d - \ud56d\ub9cc\uc0ac\ud68c\uac04\uc811\uc790\ubcf8\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Factor Analysis of Port Investment\'s Impact on Maritime Traffic: A Focus on Port SOC"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Factor Analysis of Port Investment\'s Impact on Maritime Traffic: A Focus on Port SOC"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc548\uc601\uade0(\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc774\uc8fc\uc6d0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc \ud22c\uc790\uac00 \uad6d\uac00 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \ud22c\uc790\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc SOC \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc9c0 \ucd94\uc815\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud328\ub110\uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uace0\uc815\ud6a8\uacfc\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec 1920\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2015\ub144 96\ub144\uac04\uc758 \uae30\uac04 \uc911 \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub0b4 1,082\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c 6\uac1c \ubd80\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ub958\ub41c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc790\ubcf8\uc2a4\ud1a1\uacfc \ud574\uc0c1 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ubd80\ub450 \uad00\ub828 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc790\ubcf8 \uc2a4\ud1a1\uc774 1.0% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uba74 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc740 0.15% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc77c\ubc18 \ubd80\ub450 \uad00\ub828 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc790\ubcf8 \uc2a4\ud1a1\uc774 1.0% \uc99d\uac00 \uc2dc \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc740 0.09% \uc99d\uac00\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubc29\ud30c\uc81c\xb7\ubc29\ud30c\ud638\uc548 \ub4f1\uc758 \ud30c\uc81c \uc2dc\uc124 \uc790\ubcf8 \uc2a4\ud1a1\uc774 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub192\uc740 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub294\ub370, \ud30c\uc81c \uc2dc\uc124 \uad00\ub828 \uc790\ubcf8 \uc2a4\ud1a1 1.0% \uc99d\uac00 \uc2dc \ud574\uc0c1 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc740 0.32% \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud68c\uadc0 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc SOC \uc99d\uac00\ub294 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ud655\ub300\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c, \uc7a5\ub798 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud568\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Recently, Korea has been witnessing the emergence of some idle ports whose cargo-handling capacities are bigger than their sea traffic, frequently raising concerns over excessive port investments. Thus, it is important to find a logical explanation for whether investments in port social overhead capital(SOC) can ultimately contribute toward increasing the traffic volume of ports, even the nation\'s economic development. In this study, using the fixed effects model with panel data, we investigate the impact of port SOC on maritime traffic. In order to investigate the relationships between port SOC and maritime volume, panel data covering a period of 97 years and 1,082 ports was applied to a regression model. Panel data could be collected by collaborating with the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism (MLIT). MLIT now periodically announces the SOC amount of Japanese ports. First, we followed the rules set by the MLIT, according to which the port SOCs was divided into six categories: \u201cthe development of new port\\", \u201cthe development of container berth\\", \u201cthe development of bulk berth\\", \u201cthe jetty facilities like breakwater\\", \u201cthe maintenance of port\\", and \u201cthe navigation facilities.\\" Then, we performed the regression analysis by setting the maritime traffic as the dependent variable and the forementioned six categories as independent variables.\\nBy applying the Hausman and LR tests, we could find that the fixed effect model is statistically more appropriate than the random effect model for this study. The primary results of this study in the fixed effect model are that the coefficients of \u201cthe development of container berth\\", \u201cthe development of bulk berth\\", \u201cthe jetty facilities\\" show a positive (+) impact on the dependent variable, the sea traffic. Contrarily, the coefficients of \u201cthe development of new port\\", \u201cthe maintenance of port\\", and \u201cthe navigation facilities\\" show a negative (\xad) impact. The coefficients of the development of container berth and the development of bulk berth show that the maritime traffic will increase by 0.15% and 0.09% if the SOC of the development of container berth or the development of bulk berth increase by 1%. The coefficient of the development of new port explains that if the SOC of the development of new port increases by 1.0%, the maritime traffic will decrease by 0.05%. In addition, the coefficients of the maintenance of port and the navigation facilities show that their elasticities for sea traffic are -0.06 and -0.09, respectively.\\nEspecially, the coefficient of \u201cthe jetty facilities like breakwater\\" has a strong impact on maritime traffic. The result of the fixed effects model regression, indicates that the maritime traffic will increase by 0.32% when the SOC of the jetty facilities increase by 1.0%. Therefore, we can conclude that port authorities(like the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries) find it appropriate to invest in port SOC including jetty facilities for increasing maritime traffic in the future."}]},"fpage":"645","lpage":"662","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.4.645","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.4.004","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002176879","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"12","volume":"32","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002176875","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\uc608\uc0b0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Structural Analysis of Port Investment Budget"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Structural Analysis of Port Investment Budget"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc774\ud0dc\ud718(\ubc30\uc7ac\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubd80 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc7ac\uc815\uc608\uc0b0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud654 \uacbd\ud5a5\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d \ub4f1 \uc911\uc18c\ud615\ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud655\ubcf4\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uc5b4\uc628 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ubc30\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc \uc608\uc0b0 \ubc30\ubd84\uc758 \ud615\ud3c9\uc131\uc744 \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud56d\ub9cc\ud22c\uc790\uc608\uc0b0\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ub300\ud615\ud56d\ub9cc \uc7ac\uc815\uc608\uc0b0 \uc9d1\uc911\ud654 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc911\uc18c\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ubbfc\uac04\ud22c\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0 \ud3b8\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\uc5b4\uc84c\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uad6d\ub0b4 5\ub300 \ud56d\ub9cc, \ubd80\uc0b0, \uc778\ucc9c, \uad11\uc591, \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4, \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uc7ac\uc815\uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \ubbfc\uac04\ud22c\uc790\uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc790\ub8cc\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc0c1\uad00\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \uc7ac\uc815 \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c \ubbfc\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0 \ubc0f \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d \ubbfc\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4. \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uad11\uc591\ud56d \ubbfc\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc124\uba85\ub825()\uc774 0.144\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc774\uc5c8\uace0 \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d \ubbfc\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0\ub3c4 0.183\uc73c\ub85c \uc5ed\uc2dc \ub0ae\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ubbfc\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0\uacfc \ud3c9\ud0dd\xb7\ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d \ubbfc\uc790 \uc608\uc0b0\uc740 \uac01\uac01 0.432\uc640 0.408\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \uc124\uba85\ub825\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In South Korea, port development has a rich history. In the early 1980\u2019s, Korea built a dedicated container terminal in Busan Port using a loan granted by International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). At that time, the commercial container port era revealed. In 2001, the \u2018development roadmap of domestic trading ports\u2019 supported a two-port system as a co-development of Busan and Gwangyang Ports so as to two-port has been gained a lot of development funds by both public and private sectors. Some of the small and medium-sized ports, such as Pyeongtaek-Dangjin, Port have different financial budget deviation tendencies than of megaports such as Busan Port. Although the development of port facilities has been announced, there have been difficulties in raising private funds to develop ports. In order to analyze the regional balance and fairness of the port investment budget allocation, this study chose five domestic large ports, Busan, Incheon, Gwangyang, Pyeongtaek-Dangjin, and Ulsan. This study analyzed the financial budget of public and private investment budgets of these ports. The modified second and newly third domestic trading port development roadmap investment budgets were used as data in this study, and an empirical analysis was conducting using correlation analysis and regression analysis. The result revealed a high correlation between the financial budget of Busan Port and private budget of Incheon Port. The financial budget of Busan Port and Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port were also found to have a high correlation. The regression analysis results revealed that the private budget of Gwangyang Port has a low explanatory degree. The R-square score also could not confirm the statistical significance at 0.144. The private budget of Ulsan Port is 0.183. However, the private budget of Incheon Port and Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port showed a relatively high explanatory power at 0.432 and 0.408 respectively. The results of the regression analysis showed that during 2006-2010 the private budget of Gwangyang Port positively affected the public budget of Busan Port. The score also confirms the statistical significance at 0.850. The private budget of Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port has relatively explanatory for public budget of Busan Port; the score is 0.378. The other ports have low explanatory power for the public budget of Busan Port. During 2011-2020, the private budget of Gwangyang Port is 0.373, Incheon has 0.360, Ulsan has 0.033, Pyeongtaek-Dangjin has an score of 0.080. Thus, Hypothesis 1 (there is a correlation between large ports and small and medium-sized ports) was partially confirmed by the correlation analysis results. Hypothesis 2 (financial budget of the large port positively affects the private budget of small and medium-sized ports) was also partially confirmed given the Incheon Port and Pyeongtaek-Dangjin Port analysis results. This study focused on regional balance of port investment budget and fairness of budget allocation. If it were to focus on another aspect such as efficiency or effectiveness as another policy evaluation criterion, it would be more efficient to concentrate investments in the one or two megaports.

For routes from Incheon and Busan Ports to Shanghai Port, in China, and Tokyo Port, in Japan, three vessels\u2014one each of 316 TEU, 1,019 TEU, and 1,740 TEU\u2014were input to investigate whether economies of scale occur in feeder routes of Korea, China, and Japan. Vessel speed, charterage, oil expenses, and loading rate were selected as variables of vessel navigation. Fluctuation rate was also researched and the optimal linear per route was presented. When each variable was input through system dynamics, the optimal linear per route varied depending on route distance, and for relatively long distances, economies of scale were experienced. When charterage was set as a variable, the effective vessel from Korea to Shanghai was the 1,019 TEU B vessel. When oil expenses and loading rate were low, vessels with low cargo capacity were effective. When the quantity of goods transported was drastically increased for the Korea, China, and Japan routes, the 1,700 vessel of C Vessel was the most effective. During navigation at the Tokyo Port, B Vessel departing Incheon Port was the most effective in oil price change, followed by C Vessel; B Vessel departing Busan Port was effective. The 300 TEU A Vessel was identified to be a navigation exemption vessel due to its navigation distance of 1,016 miles from Incheon Port. The optimal vessel for oil price change was B Vessel leaving for Shanghai Port; however, it should be a substitute for C Vessel when the charterage and quantity of goods transported between the routes are increased. Regardless of oil price change between these routes, A Vessel had low competitiveness and its transportation unit price would be lower when the vessel lowers the speed considering oil price variability. Concerning the routes to Tokyo Port, the navigation distance from Busan Port was shorter than that from Incheon Port, and therefore, B Vessel was effective, unlike C Vessel.\\nThe cost of each unit depending on the loading rate had a greater effect on navigation expenses than charterage and oil price change. For Shanghai Port, at 100% loading rate, the optimal vessels were C Vessel, B Vessel, and C Vessel. At 50%, B Vessel and C Vessel were effective. A Vessel was more effective at 100% loading rate (300 TEU) than B Vessel at 50% (500 TEU) loading rate. This finding implies that oil expenses and charterage, which are external market elements, were greatly reflected, and therefore, it is not economical. Moreover, for Busan and Tokyo Ports, the navigation distances were shorter than the route of Incheon Port; therefore, B Vessel was effective. When the loading rate of A Vessel was enhanced and its speed was reduced, thus decreasing total navigation expenses, it was more effective for short distances. This study can be helpful to long-term vessel operations on the Korea, China, and Japan routes. Feeder vessel companies are relatively small in comparison to large ones and hence need long-term monitoring, which has thus far been neglected. The former also need prompt and flexible measures to cope with the unstable marine transportation market environment and are required to decide vessel input through long-term monitoring of external environmental factors."}]},"fpage":"599","lpage":"623","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.4.599","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.4.001","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002176872","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"12","volume":"32","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002176869","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6d0\uc591\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \uadfc\ud574\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc5ed\ub0b4 \ud574\uc6b4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Service Networks between Trunk and Feeder Liners in the intra-Asia Container Shipping Market: A Comparison Study"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Service Networks between Trunk and Feeder Liners in the intra-Asia Container Shipping Market: A Comparison Study"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc11d\uc218(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ubb3c\ub958\uc804\ubb38\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc774\uc0c1\uc724(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","Alexander Shishkov(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc5ed\ub0b4 \uc815\uae30\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\uc591\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \uadfc\ud574\uc120\uc0ac\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\uad6c\ub3c4\ub97c \ud615\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0 \uadf8 \uc724\uacfd\uc744 \uadf8\ub824\ubcf4\ub294 \ub370 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc120\uc0ac \uac04, \uc120\uc0ac \uadf8\ub8f9 \uac04 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \uc0ac\ud68c \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc138\uacc4 20\ub300 \uc815\uae30 \uc120\uc0ac \uc911 12\uac1c \uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 8\uac1c \uadfc\ud574\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc0ac\ubcc4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc131\uacfc \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uac04 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uc6d0\uc591\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uacfc \uadfc\ud574\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc5ed\ub0b4 \uc815\uae30\uc120 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc720\uc0ac\uc131\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uadfc\ud574\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc601\uc5ed\uc774\uc5c8\ub358 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc5ed\ub0b4 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\uc591\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc790\ub85c \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uacbd\uc7c1\uad6c\ub3c4\uac00 \uace0\ub3c4\ud654\ub420 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \uc2dc\uc0ac\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study aims to outline the competitive landscape of the trunk and feeder liners in the intra-Asia container shipping market. The Social Network Analysis (SNA) method is used to evaluate the similarities and differences in the intra-Asia container shipping service networks between: (i)20 liners, and (ii)12 global trunk liners and 8 Korean feeder liners. Presently, 12 out of the global top 20 carriers are operating in the intra-Asia market. This study focuses on these trunk and feeder liners by conducting an empirical analysis to measure selected network connectivity indices, and to compare similarities in the structure of the liner shipping service networks. This empirical study reveals that, in the intra-Asia container market, three trunk liners(MCC transports, Evergreen, and Wanhai) and two domestic liners(Heung-A and KMTC) have dominant market share in terms of network connectivity, which is measured by the number of links between the ports, network density, connection degree, and inclusiveness. Therefore, it is evident that these five carriers operate in a relatively high level of networks in the intra-Asia region. MCC transports, a subsidiary of Maersk located in Singapore, has built an equivalent level of an intra-Asia service network with other competitive Asian origin trunk and feeder companies, such as Evergreen, Hanjin, HMM, Heung-A, and KMTC which have abundant management experiences in the intra-Asia shipping market. It has not been long since the global mega carriers entered the intra-Asia market; however, it seems that the Danish giant has been gaining access to the traditional business areas of Asian container shipping companies. In particular, at the group level comparison, connectivity indices indicate that the feeder liner group only has a small advantage over the trunk liner group; although it dose not seem to be significant. Futhermore, a correlation analysis of the networks of each company revealed that many shipping firms operating in the intra-Asia route had established similar types of service networks. As the eight feeder liners are Korean companies, it can be said that their similarity is natural; however, a similar situation is observed with the trunk liners. In addition, the correlation analysis of the integrated networks for the two different liner groups also presents a high level of similarity in the intra-Asia shipping market. This result can be considered a warning to the Korean feeder liners that, in the near future, the intra-Asia routes will become more competitive. Eventually, when the trunk liners\u2019 Panamax vessels will be transitioned from the current trans-Pacific route into the intra-Asia service network due to the expansion of the Panama Cannel in June 2016, the market competition will be more intense. Consequently, the Korean shipping lines need to build a strategic policy to enhance their competitiveness in the intra-Asia liner market."}]},"fpage":"579","lpage":"598","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.4.579","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.4.002","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002176869","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"09","volume":"32","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002147265","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf4\uc138\uacf5\uc7a5\uc81c\ub3c4 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Determinants of Korean SMEs\' Decision to Use the Bonded Factory System"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Determinants of Korean SMEs\' Decision to Use the Bonded Factory System"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc31\ud76c\ucc9c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\ud601\uc218(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uac1c\ubcc4\uad6d\uac00\ub9c8\ub2e4 \uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc774\uc775\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc0f \uad6d\uac00\uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud06c\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ubd80\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc81c\ub3c4(\uc870\uc138, \uc790\uae08, \uae30\uc220\uc9c0\uc6d0 \ub4f1)\uac00 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc815\ubd80\ub3c4 \uae30\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc81c\uace0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc911 \ud558\ub098\uac00 \ubc14\ub85c \u2018\ubcf4\uc138\uacf5\uc7a5\uc81c\ub3c4\u2019\uc774\ub2e4. \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5 \uc785\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\uc785\ud1b5\uad00 \uc2dc \ubc1c\uc0dd\ub418\ub294 \uad00\uc138 \ubc0f \ubd80\uac00\uc138\uc758 \ub0a9\ubd80\uac00 \ubb3c\ub958 \uad00\ub828 \ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc0c1\ub2f9 \ubd80\ubd84\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958 \uad00\ub828 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc790\uae08 \ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc778 \ubcf4\uc138\uacf5\uc7a5\uc81c\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc785 \ud639\uc740 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. 293\uac1c \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uad6c\uc870\ubc29\uc815\uc2dd\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \ucd5c\uace0\uacbd\uc601\uc790\uc758 \uc815\ubd80\uc9c0\uc6d0 \uc81c\ub3c4 \uad00\ub828 \uacbd\ud5d8, \uc81c\ub3c4\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc21c\uc751\uc131, \uc815\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc790\uc0b0 \ub4f1\uc774 \ubcf4\uc138\uacf5\uc7a5\uc81c\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc785 \ud639\uc740 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uad00\ub828 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc790\uc6d0\uae30\ubc18\uc774\ub860, \uac70\ub798\ube44\uc6a9\uc774\ub860, \uc81c\ub3c4\uc774\ub860 \ub4f1\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc774 \uac80\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Many countries have established various policies to support domestic companies, especially Small- and Medium-sized Enterprises(SMEs). These companies are recognized as contributors to local and national economies. This is why many governments assist SMEs via various policies pertaining to taxation, finance, and technology support. The Korean government also implements several supporting policies, one of them being the \u2018bonded factory system\u2019. When companies export or import products, they may bear costs such as duty and Valued-Added Tax(VAT). The bonded factory system can be an alternative for companies to reduce costs. This is particularly important for a country like Korea, whose natural resources are very limited. Therefore, Korean companies need to procure raw materials from abroad to produce goods. The bonded factory system may play an important role for Korean companies in terms of decreasing costs and increasing competitiveness in the global marketplace. Consequently, this study focuses on the factors affecting the adoption of the bonded factory system by SMEs in Korea.\\nWe discuss various determinants concerning awareness and use of the bonded factory system with regard to Korean SMEs. Based on the theoretical foundation and previous studies, we offer several hypotheses. To analyze the bonded factory system, we apply the Resource-Based View(RBV), Transaction Costs Analysis (TCA), Institutional Theory (IT), and Technology Acceptance Model(TAM) as the theoretical foundation. For example, the effects of using the bonded factory system on information system assets are analyzed using the RBV. The TCA helps explain the effects of using the bonded factory system on the sensitivity of bonded products. The effects of using the bonded factory system on strategic conformity to institutions, particularly regulatory ones, are theoretically explained by the IT and the TAM.\\nThis study empirically analyzes the relationship among selected variables. We collect data from 293 Korean SMEs involved in export/import and using bonded factory system. We use Structural Equation Modeling to analyze the firm data. Before testing causal relationships, Confirmatory Factor Analysis, Chronbach\'s Alpha, and Average Variance Extracted are used to confirm validity and reliability. We face no specific problems with regard to the indexes. The empirical findings show that most of the hypotheses(H1, H2, H4, and H5) are supported, but others(H3 and H6) are rejected. Specifically, the CEO\'s experiences regarding government support policies, strategic conformity characteristics concerning regulatory institutions, and information system assets are positively associated with SMEs\' awareness about the bonded factory system. Moreover, SMEs with better understanding of the bonded factory system are more likely to use it. These theoretical and empirical findings provide implications for policy makers and firm mangers regarding the bonded factory system."}]},"fpage":"539","lpage":"558","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.3.539","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.3.006","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002147265","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"09","volume":"32","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002147272","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \u5c0d \uc778\ub3c4\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 \uc218\ucd9c\uc785 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uacfc \ud55c\xb7ASEAN FTA \ud6a8\uacfc"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Determinants of Seaborne Trading Volume for Indonesia in Korea and Korea-ASEAN FTA Effects"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Determinants of Seaborne Trading Volume for Indonesia in Korea and Korea-ASEAN FTA Effects"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ucc3d\ubc94(\uc804\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uac1c\ubc1c\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)","\uc774\ubbfc\ud76c(\uc870\uc120\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8\uace0\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \u5c0d \uc778\ub3c4\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 \uc218\ucd9c\uc785 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc774\ub4e4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774 \uc218\ucd9c\uc785 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0, \ud55c\xb7ASEAN FTA\uac00 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \u5c0d \uc778\ub3c4\ub124\uc2dc\uc544 \ud574\uc0c1\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc7a5\uae30\uade0\ud615\uc2dd\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uacb0\uacfc, \uc138\uacc4\uacbd\uae30\uc758 \ud638\uc870\uc640 \uad6d\uc81c\uc720\uac00\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc740 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uad6d\ub0b4\uacbd\uae30\uc640 \uc138\uacc4\uc0c1\ud488\uac00\uaca9\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc740 \uc218\uc785\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \uc99d\uac00\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8 \uad6d\uc81c\uc720\uac00\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0\ub294 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\ucce4\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc218\uc785\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0\ub294 \ubd80\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc624\ucc28\uc218\uc815\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \ucd94\uc815\uacb0\uacfc, \uc624\ucc28\uc218\uc815\ud56d\uc774 \uc74c(-)\uc758 \ubd80\ud638\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uba74\uc11c \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\uc758\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc774 \uc870\uc815\uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \uc218\uc785\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud6e8\uc52c \ube60\ub974\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uac8c\ub2e4\uac00, \ud55c\xb7 ASEAN FTA \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc FTA\uccb4\uacb0 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc774 \uc218\uc785\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub354 \ud070 \ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, 2013\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2014\ub144 \uae30\uac04\uc5d0\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uacfc \uc218\uc785\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc774 \uac01\uac01 \ud070 \ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ud3ed\uc774 \ub454\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Economic cooperation between Korea and Indonesia was established on the basis of the effectiveness of Korea-ASEAN FTA in 2007. The ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), launched in 2015 and comprising 10 ASEAN countries, offered an opportunity to expand the cooperation in economy, trade, and logistics. Indonesia has occupied an important position in terms of trade and investments of Korea. Among the ASEAN countries, Indonesia is the 9th export market of Korea as of 2014 (USD 113.6 billion), and the investment scale of Korea in Indonesia has reached 7th place (USD1.13 billion). Particularly, as the Indonesian government is planning the construction and expansion of regional infrastructure for development in the ocean industry, it will serve as an opportunity for Korean companies in terms of investments. Among the ASEAN countries, Indonesia has accounted for 17.8% and 56.7% of the entire export volume and import volume of South Korea as of 2014, respectively. In 2014, the export volume and import volume stood at 9.72 million ton(R/T) and 51.33 million ton(R/T), respectively. However, the annual import and export volume growth is slow. In addition, in 2014, the largest export volume from the ports of Korea to Indonesia were mineral fuels (55.0%), followed by steel products (19.0%) and petrochemical products (6.6%). The largest imports were mineral fuels (90.7%), followed by agricultural products (3.7%) and paper stock/paper products (1.5%). Thus, Indonesia is very important in terms of trade and volume. Despite its importance, the empirical research on Korea\u2019s logistics for Indonesia is insufficient. In such a context, this paper aims to identify the determinants of Korea\u2019s import and export trade volume for Indonesia and analyze the effects of Korea-ASEAN FTA on the country\u2019s seaborne trading volume for Indonesia. The empirical results are as follows. First, the result suggests that a 10% increase in global economy activity (GEA) and the world petroleum price (WPP) increase the export trade volume by 26.6% and 4.70% respectively. This result emphasizes the important role of GEA in increasing export trade volume to Indonesia in Korea. The relative real effective exchange rates (REER) variable has negative and significant impact on export trade volume, where a 10% increase in the REER decreases export trade volume by 15.8%. Second, the result suggests that a 10% increase in Korean economy activity (KEA) increase the import trade volume by 16.7%. The WCP variable has positive and significant impact on import trade volume, where a 10% increase in the WCP increases import trade volume by 2.56%. Whereas, the world petroleum price (WPP) variable has negative and significant impact on import trade volume, where a 10% increase in the WPP decreases import trade volume by 1.22%.

However, the loading and unloading operations are subject to the waiting time needed to perform lifting operations by the forklift. To solve this problem of increased waiting time, the loading and unloading system can perform the operation by batched pallet with its own power. Recently, a design that uses a simulation method was proposed to minimize the error in the new system in warehouses and utilize multiple simulation techniques to reduce design time. Previous studies reviewed the simulation model to check specific changes in the performance of the new system when it was introduced in a warehouse. This study dose a comparative analysis of the performance of the proposed alternative and the current designs. In order to efficiently perform repeated work in a limited space, we provide three alternatives to support the batch loading and unloading operation. They are the general-purpose system, dedicated system, and system for a wing-body truck. The simulation model has been developed to compare the productivity of the proposed system to that of the current system. The alternatives proposed to improve the performance of forklift system for use in current warehouse operations of loading and unloading improves each palletizing operation by simultaneously reversing the batch up and down the upper and lower stations as opposed to the batch lifting method for individual tasks, thereby, decreasing the waiting time of the forklift. The cargo loading and unloading system that uses the specification designed to target a prototype testing phase, with the input data as presented in this study, does not reflect the operating conditions of a complete warehouse. As a result, it means that if the truck service is improved and the waiting time of the forklift is greatly reduced, then the number of forklifts required to handle external trucks can be reduced sufficiently. However, the introduction of the new system requires the generation of a large initial investment, which also depends on the application of warehouse specific size and volume needed to perform a productivity level analysis using quantitative economics. The design support simulator plays a role in periodically simulating and calculating the actual forklift\u2019s movement, according to the operational rules, and the transfers of cargos by stacking rules. By using statistics measures, we can design its physical layout. This study aim to provide feasible alternatives for batch loading and unloading systems used in warehouses. The result of this study should take into consideration the design of warehouses as well."}]},"fpage":"497","lpage":"519","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.3.497","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.3.001","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002147254","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"09","volume":"32","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002147225","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c\xb7\uc6b4\uc601: TBL\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Sustainable Port Development and Operation Focusing on Triple Bottom Line"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Sustainable Port Development and Operation Focusing on Triple Bottom Line"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ub178\uc138\uc5f0(Plymouth \ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc8fc\ud638(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc7a5\ud604\ubbf8(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc724\uc6d0\uc601(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uac1c\ubc1c\xb7\uc6b4\uc601\uc740 \uacfc\uac70 \ud658\uacbd\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c\ub9cc \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub358 \uac83\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ucd5c\uadfc \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801\xb7\uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud56d\ub9cc \uac1c\ubc1c\xb7\uc6b4\uc601\uc740 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ub3c4\uc804\uc5d0 \uad6d\uba74\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \uac1c\ubc1c\uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubbf8\ub798 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc544\uac00\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\xb7\uc6b4\uc601\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\uacbd\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uadf8\ub9b0 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \ucd09\uc9c4\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud65c\ub3d9\uc774 \ucd94\uc9c4\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ud658\uacbd\xb7\uc0ac\ud68c\xb7\uacbd\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \uace0\ub824\ud55c Triple Bottom Line\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \uae30\uc900\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc774\uace0, \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c\uc9c0 \uc124\uba85\ud574 \uc8fc\ub294 \ud3ec\uad04\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub4dc\ubb3c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \ubc0f \ud574\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0, \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \uad6c\uc131\ud558\ub294 3\uac00\uc9c0 \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud574 \ubd04\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Increasing environmental pressure and awareness, such as the impact of climate change, posit new challenges to port development that, in turn, call for measures aiming at minimizing their impact and pursuing sustainable operations. In this respect, several legislations relating to the construction and extension of ports have been introduced at both international and national levels in a timely manner to minimize the environmental impact and pursue sustainable operations in the long run. Based on stricter standards, these legislations aim to incorporate environmental issues into core strategies of port development. Therefore, sustainability is increasingly seen as a key driver of port development in the next decades.\\nNew ports are being constructed and existing ports are being expanded throughout the world to meet the increasing demand of population and requirements from various industries (Gupta et al. 2005). Ports must plan and manage their future developments (growth and expansion) and operations in a sustainable manner in order to cope with the limited or decreased environmental space and intensified interactions with their hinterlands. The required harmony of ports with their surrounding cities clearly renders green growth an important economic driver (Black, 1996). In this respect, several studies have measured ports\u2019 sustainable performance (i.e., Chin and Low, 2010; Lirn et al. 2012; Tsinker, 2004; Wiegmans and Louw, 2011). Rather than studying the impact of sustainability in port management, most of the literature related to sustainable port development is focused on ecological issues (i.e., Berechman and Tseng, 2012; Dinwoodie et al. 2012; Liao et al. 2010) and monitoring of environmental impacts (i.e., Darbra et al. 2004, 2005; Gupta et al. 2005; Wooldridge et al. 1999). Recently, some authors analyzed the strategic issues (i.e., Denktas-Sakar and Caratas-Cetin, 2012; Haezendonck et al. 2006) and operations of green ports (i.e., Acciaro et al. 2014), contributing to the identification of the value addition that environmental performance might bring to ports. Among a few studies on the impact of sustainability in port management, only environmental (i.e., Gouliemos, 2000; Le et al. 2014; Peris-Mora et al. 2005; Villalba and Gemechu, 2011) or both economic and environmental aspects of sustainability have been considered (i.e., Asgari et al. 2015). Yap and Lam (2013) studied the impact of ports\u2019 spatial expansion development on the environmental, economic, and social dimensions. They emphasized that it is even more important to address ecological issues at the planning stage and before terminal construction of any future port development project than taking note of green port practices when the port is already in operation. Nevertheless, there is little information that clearly and comprehensively describes what sustainable port development actually entails or, in other words, what are considered as sustainable port development indicators. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the main factors that shape sustainable port development by identifying overseas and Korean cases and examining how these ports practice sustainable development in order to suggest academic, managerial, and policy implications."}]},"fpage":"473","lpage":"495","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.3.473","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.3.002","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002147225","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"09","volume":"32","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002147213","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc138\uc6d4\ud638\ucc38\uc0ac \uc774\ud6c4 \ub0b4\ud56d\uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc6b4\uc784\uc81c\ub3c4 \ubcc0\ud654\uace0\ucc30 - \uc720\ub958\ube44\ud560\uc99d \ub3c4\uc785 -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Fare Rearrangement of Coastwise Passenger Transport after the Disaster of the Sewol Ferry - Introduction of Bunkering Surcharge -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Fare Rearrangement of Coastwise Passenger Transport after the Disaster of the Sewol Ferry - Introduction of Bunkering Surcharge -"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ubc15\uc6a9\uc548(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2014\ub144\uc758 \uc138\uc6d4\ud638\ucc38\uc0ac \uc774\ud6c4 \ub0b4\ud56d\uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub958\ube44\ud560\uc99d\uc81c \ub3c4\uc785\uc744 \uace0\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub0b4\ud56d\uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\ub294 \uc138\uc6d4\ud638\ucc38\uc0ac \uc774\ud6c4 \uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5d0\uc11c \uac15\ud654\ub41c \uac01\uc885 \uc548\uc804\uad00\ub828 \uae30\uc900\uacfc \uaddc\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd94\uac00\uc801 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ubd80\ub2f4\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uc218\uae09\uc548\uc815\uacfc \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uacf5\uae09\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc0ac\uc5c5\ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uc801\uc815\ud558\uac8c \uc6b4\uc784\uc5d0 \ubc18\uc601\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub0b4\ud56d\uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\ub4e4\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud328\ub110\uc790\ub8cc \uc218\uc9d1\uacfc \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uac80\ud1a0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ub0b4\ud56d\uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \uc720\ub958\ube44\ud560\uc99d \uc81c\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc785\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\uc6a9\uc5ec\uac1d\ub4e4\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\ubd80\ub2f4\uc744 \uc904\uc774\ub294 \ub370\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0, \ucd1d\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc720\ub958\ube44 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud55c \uc720\ub958\ube44\ud560\uc99d \uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \ub17c\uc758\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc6b4\uc784\uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \ub3c4\uc785\uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc2e4\uc81c \uad00\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \uac80\ud1a0 \ub0b4\uc6a9\ub4e4\uc744 \uc801\uc2dc\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc5ec\uac1d\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc784\uc81c\ub3c4 \ubcc0\uacbd \uc2dc \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study is concerning the newly introduced bunkering surcharge to the coastwise passenger transport services after the disaster of the Sewol ferry sinking in 2014. The tragedy of the Sewol awakened the coastwise passenger transport industry to more strictly enforce various safety standards and regulations. To meet needs of the industry to provide safe and sustainable services to coastal passengers, it is necessary to charge these additional costs to passengers. In other sectors of the transport industries domestically and abroad, bunkering surcharge has been applied to cover rising fuel prices. This paper discusses a possible introduction of bunkering surcharge to the coastwise passenger transport, by strictly screening the cost structure of the coastwise passenger transport industry. The unit price of fuels is based on the prices provided to the Korean Shipping Association members. In this paper, a bunkering surcharge scheme is discussed and the relationship between the incurred costs to the firms in the coastwise passenger transport services and fuel prices are considered. Fuel prices to the coastwise passenger transport companies are a reflection of the international fuel prices. Taking this into account, cost functions of changes in relation to fuel prices are discussed. A sensitivity analysis model of cost changes in calculating service costs adopted a cost function, generally applied in microeconomics, shall be applied. For this purpose, panel data had been collected. Panel data include the data from 220 coastal shipping vessels, over the past 5 years, from 2009 to 2013. The types of vessels in the data are composed of 22 high speed ferries, 19 traditional ferries, 115 small scale car-ferries, 27 super-speed ferries, 21 car ferries and 16 speed jet ferries. Findings of a panel regression analysis show a statistical significance and difference in sensitivity by vessel type. In the final analysis, it was difficult to apply each sensitivity by vessel type directly. So an average sensitivity of all vessel types is applied as a base in determining the bunkering surcharge. According to the proposed bunkering surcharge scheme, an average price of MGO(H), the general fuel mostly used by the coastwise passenger transport companies during 2004-2013, should be set at 670 Korean Won per liter as a base. This surcharge may then be applied two times per year according to the changes in oil. After implementing the bunkering surcharge scheme, it is recommended to examine the scheme in relationship of changes in demand of passengers against the surcharge imposed."}]},"fpage":"457","lpage":"471","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.3.457","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.3.005","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002147213","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"09","volume":"32","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002147202","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uac04 \uc5f0\uacc4\uad6c\uc870 - \uc0ac\ud68c\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Interindustrial Linkages of the Shipping and Logistics Industry - A Social Network Analysis Using Input - output Tables -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Interindustrial Linkages of the Shipping and Logistics Industry - A Social Network Analysis Using Input - output Tables -"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ubcc0\uc7a5\uc12d(\uc804\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uac1c\ubc1c\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2010\ub144\ub3c4 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc0ac\ud68c\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uac04 \uc5f0\uacc4\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uac00\uc0c1\ucd94\ucd9c\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uc744 \uad6d\ubbfc\uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uc600\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4\uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4, \uccab\uc9f8, \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uac04 \uc5f0\uacc4\uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc740 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc218\uc785\uac70\ub798\uc5d0 \uc758\uc874\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud574\uc678\uc758 \uc218\uc694\ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc5f0\uacc4\ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 \uc11d\ud0c4 \ubc0f \uc11d\uc720\uc81c\ud488 \uc81c\uc870\uc5c5, \uad11\uc5c5, \uc6b4\uc218\uc5c5, \ubd80\ub3d9\uc0b0 \ubc0f \uc784\ub300\uc5c5 \ub4f1 \uc774\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uac04 \uc5f0\uacc4\uad6c\uc870\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc911\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uad6d\uac00\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc815\ucc45\uc0c1 \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uc744 \uc721\uc131\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc6b0\uc120 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study examines the interindustrial linkages of the shipping and logistics industry, focusing on Social Network Analysis (SNA) via input-output tables. Specifically, using the Hypothetical Extraction Method (HEM) for interindustry analysis, this study explores the changes in the interindustrial linkages of entire industries after excluding the shipping and logistics industry from the national economy. The empirical analysis provides the following four results. First, the degree centrality of the shipping and logistics industry is estimated to be low, namely, it does not play a central role in the interindustrial linkages of entire industries. Third, this study utilizes the HEM to estimate the interindustrial linkages of the shipping and logistics industry due to a change in the final demand, and finds that the shipping and logistics industry has many links with other industries, such as transportation (for equipment, rent, and fuel), petroleum and coal product manufacturing, mining and quarrying, and real estate and leasing. Lastly, utilizing the HEM, this study compares the effects with regard to interindustrial linkages before and after excluding the shipping and logistics industry, and finds that the above-mentioned industries experience the largest decrease in their respective prestige centrality. In other words, these industries may be recognized as having the highest linkages with the shipping and logistics industry. In conclusion, the shipping and logistics industry does not play a central role in interindustrial linkages. However, the following industries show high economic linkage effects owing to the shipping and logistics industry, as they play a central role in the interindustrial linkages with this industry: petroleum and coal product manufacturing, mining and quarrying, transportation, and real estate and leasing. Therefore, in order to foster the shipping and logistics industry through national industrial policies, governments must preferentially consider the corresponding linkage policies with these industries. This study estimates the interindustrial linkages of the shipping and logistics industry using input-output tables at the level. However, the features of the shipping and logistics industry for different regions will vary with regard to the regional economies. Therefore, future studies should use regional input-output tables, so as to be able to derive suitable regional-level policy implications for the shipping and logistics industry."}]},"fpage":"435","lpage":"455","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.3.435","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.3.003","citation-count":"9","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002147202","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117586","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc911\uad6d \uc77c\ub300\uc77c\ub85c(OBOR) \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub3d9\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis of the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d Research Trend Using Social Network Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis of the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d Research Trend Using Social Network Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc1a1\ubbfc\uadfc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\ucc28\uc601\ub450(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SNA(Social Network Analysis)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uad6d \uc77c\ub300\uc77c\ub85c \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c \ub3d9\ud5a5\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc911\uad6d\uacfc \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uc77c\ub300\uc77c\ub85c \uc5f0\uad6c \ub17c\ubb38\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud588\uc73c\uba70 \uc911\uad6d 341\uac1c, \ud55c\uad6d 73\uac1c \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud588\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uacf5\ud1b5\uc801\uc73c\ub85c OBOR, Trade, Cooperation \ub4f1\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \ube48\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uace0, \ud55c\uad6d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 Eurasia Initiative\uc5d0\uc11c \ub192\uc740 \ube48\ub3c4\uac00 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uacb0 \uc911\uc2ec\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c Strategy, China, Cooperation, Development, Trade, International, Logistics\ub4f1\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub9e4\uac1c \uc911\uc2ec\uc131\ub3c4 \uc5f0\uacb0\uc911\uc2ec\uc131\uacfc \ud070 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud55c\uad6d \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc5d0\uc120 AIIB, Eurasia \ub4f1\uc774 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uac1c\ubcc4\ub2e8\uc5b4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub97c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544, \uc778\ub3c4, \ubbf8\uad6d \ub4f1 \uc8fc\uc694\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \uad00\ub828 \ud0a4\uc6cc\ub4dc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \ud55c\uad6d\uc774 \uc911\uad6d\uacfc \ub300\ube44\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubcc4\uad6d\uac00 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Chinese government has expressed commitment toward the \u201cOne Belt, One Road\u201d (OBOR) project, which aims to construct large-scale logistics infrastructure across an extensive region spanning Central, West, and South Asia; the Persian Gulf; the Mediterranean Sea; the Indian Ocean; Europe; and the South Pacific. Additionally, the OBOR project activities between China and other major countries are already underway. In South Korea, the OBOR project has been drawing increasing attention of the central government, local governments, and major research institutes such as those pertaining to logistics (shipping, transportation), economy, trade, politics, diplomacy, culture and so on.\\nAs OBOR would be conducted by China and several other countries, there could be diverse viewpoints highlighting the \u201cpositives,\u201d \u201cnegatives,\u201d \u201copportunities,\u201d and \u201cthreats\u201d of the project. Every single country associated with the OBOR project would have its own interpretation and approach. The correspondence strategies and projects derived from every single country would together constitute the OBOR project. To understand the project properly and find out the best way to cooperate, cope with, and utilize, there is a need for continuous and patient research. The research should be focused not only on the general understanding of OBOR but also on its specific projects in major countries.\\nThe purpose of this study is to identify the research trend regarding the OBOR project using SNA (social network analysis). The analysis was conducted by reviewing OBOR-related research papers published in China and South Korea as of April 2016. A total of 2,046 and 335 keywords were derived from the total keywords presented in 341 papers of China and 73 papers of Korea, respectively, for constructing a keyword network. Frequency analyses demonstrated that words such as \u201cOBOR,\u201d \u201ctrade,\u201d and \u201ccooperation\u201d showed high frequencies in both China and Korea, while \u201cEurasia initiative\u201d showed a high frequency in the Korean papers. In addition, in terms of network connection centrality, \u201cstrategy,\u201d \u201cChina,\u201d \u201ccooperation,\u201d \u201cdevelopment,\u201d \u201ctrade,\u201d \u201cinternational,\u201d and \u201clogistics\u201d ranked high in both China and Korea. Although the difference between connection centrality and mediation centrality was not much, some mediation centrality keywords such as \u201cAIIB\u201d (which stands for Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank) and \u201cEurasia\u201d had relatively high frequencies in Korea. Analysis on close centrality demonstrated that the Chinese papers showed significant values for \u201ccapital account liberalization,\u201d \u201cbusiness ethics,\u201d and \u201clone wolf.\u201d In addition, individual word networks were constructed with country names to derive keywords related to major countries, such as Russia, Mongolia, Pakistan, India, Vietnam and the United States.

As already well known, the OBOR initiative is a grand strategy proposed by the People\u2019s Republic of China(PRC), which consists of two pivotal components: building of the Silk Road Belt and that of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.\\nThe OBOR initiative is largely understood as the PRC\u2019s ambitious international proposal for developing six economic corridors across the Eurasian continent, which includes 26 countries, accounting for about 68% of the world population, 29% of the world\u2019s total GDP, and 23.9% of the world\u2019s total trade, mainly by constructing transport/logistics infrastructures, industrial complexes, and improving their intra- and inter-regional connectivities.\\nDeparting from this existing approach, this study attempts to understand the OBOR as a China-centered movement for reshaping the global value chains(GVCs) coupled with the \u201cMade in China 2025,\u201d another ambitious long-term plan for innovating China\u2019s manufacturing capabilities and international competitiveness. In the study, the GVCs are considered a key background concept that can explain correlation between the recent shift of China\u2019s Foreign Direct Investment patterns and the construction of the OBOR.\\nThe study aims to predict the future course of expansion of the international production networks, which will be initiated by PRC, and is expected to be accelerated by the OBOR, while searching for South Korea\u2019s future course and its reactions as a global logistics player. By doing so, the study proposes four strategic options including leading, bandwagoning, balancing, and strategic hedging, which can be selectively adopted or flexibly blended according to the respective geopolitical environments of the six economic corridors embedded in the OBOR.\\nAs a possible strategic option toward the China proper (or Chinese mainland), which may be considered the conceptional gateway and international hub of the OBOR, the study recommends the bandwagoning to South Korea, which means matching China\u2019s national plans relating to logistics development as well as production networks, paying sharp attentions on moving of China\u2019s development strategies including the \u201cGo West\u201d strategy. On the other hand, regarding a possible option toward China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor(CMREC), the study put an emphasis on the necessity of choosing leading option despite of uncertainty of inter-Korean relationship.\\nIn conclusion, the study put an emphasis on keeping a balance in South Korea\u2019s policy stance toward the OBOR, re-estimating the importance and the potential of southern maritime economic corridors in terms of the consolidation of South Korea\u2019s own GVCs and acceleration of going abroad policy in logistics businesses."}]},"fpage":"361","lpage":"385","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.361","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.009","citation-count":"17","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117573","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117549","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4\uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc \uacfc\uc81c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Selective & Task on Utilizing Port Business management via AHP"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Selective & Task on Utilizing Port Business management via AHP"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ub958\ud648\ucc9c(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc131\ud638(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc94\uc704\uacbd\uc81c\ub85c, \ud2b9\uc218\uc131\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e4\uc6d0\uc8fc\uc758\uc640 \ubcf4\ud3b8\uc8fc\uc758\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\uba70 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub2e4. \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac\uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uad00\ub9ac\ub294 \uad6d\uac00 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b4\uc601\uacfc \uc790\uc728\uc131, \uacbd\uc601\ub9c8\uc778\ub4dc, \uc804\ubb38\uc131, \uc791\uc740 \uc815\ubd80 \uc9c0\ud5a5\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ud558\uace0 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac\uc81c\ub3c4(PA: Port Authority)\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569\ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\ud654\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c4\ucd9c\uc744 \ud655\ub300\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a5\uc810\uc774 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud56d\ub9cc\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \ud3c9\uac00\uc694\uc18c\ub85c\uc11c \uacbd\uc81c\uc131, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc77c\uad00\uc131, \uc548\uc815\uc131, \uacbd\uc7c1\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc131\uc774 1\uc21c\uc704\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \ud070 \ud3c9\uac00\uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac \uad00\ub9ac \ud615\ud0dc \uc21c\uc704\ub294 1\uc21c\uc704 \ud1b5\ud569, 2\uc21c\uc704\ub85c \ud604\ud589\uc720\uc9c0\ub85c \uacc4\uce35 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uce21\uc815 \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac \ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc640 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\ub97c \uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c \uad6d\uc81c\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654\uc640 \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc801\ud569\uc131\uc744 \uc694\uad6c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"General condition of international management has been shifted to economy of scope from economy of scale and also transformed into pursuing efficiency from just featuring its distinctiveness. To maximize such efficiency, it should be integrated and managed in proper size and that way, we would be able to reinforce its competency. In addition, the marrow of the enhanced competency is applying creativity and convergence and various public institutions are recently working on it to fortify their competency. However, Korean government\u2019s policy is more focusing on privatization than nationalization and the government has established Port Authority (PA). The function of PA aims to fostering autonomy of management, autonomy, entrepreneurship, professionalism, small government policy, cost-effectiveness, and overall efficiency Numerous harbors around the world have been enlarged and globalized. Naturally, many opinions on PA have been growing and they are mainly about integration of PA once again. In addition, many ideas are now focusing on how to integrate and what procedures will be applied. In details, there are some perspectives whether the integration is surely appropriate, urgent, beneficial, and inevitable especially since competition of harbors in the North-East region has been fierce and there will be more harbors in the near future and the business model of the region is mainly based on direct lines for large vessels.\\nMoreover, the nations in the region are fostering logistics hub ports Due to FTA, countries in North-East region are changing their industrial locations in order to deal with non-tariff barriers. Consequently, there have been changes on logistics networks and it requires PA focusing on building sustainable capability for efficient management. Integration of PA features a great chance of expanding its markets internationally This paper is based on AHP approach to identify priority on merging PAs. The factors of evaluation are: economic feasibility, efficiency consistency, stability, and competency Outcome of the analysis shows competency is the crucial factor. Also, when it comes to proposal for PA integration, merging turns out to be the best solution and maintaining the current structure comes in second. In order to utilize PA, it requires distinctiveness of environment of harbors and shipping companies, unique system, enhanced international competency, and efficiency and suitability of management. First of all, Global Terminal Operator (GTO) pursues dualization of scale and diversification of business. Second, logistics market has been integrating in a great size so it requires PA to achieve the optimal solution: pushing through economy of scale and scope at the same time. Third, PA needs to set an evaluation standard on harbors based on long-term perspective, objectivity, validity, and fairness. To utilize PA, cooperation between foreign harbors is crucial and strategic partnership, fortifying its capability and complementary collaboration are required because PA features environmental and regional distinctiveness. Thus, enhancing its international capability via global cooperation and integration is required."}]},"fpage":"347","lpage":"360","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.347","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.005","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117549","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117536","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis of Increasing Competitiveness for the Logistics Center in Incheon Port\'s Hinterland"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis of Increasing Competitiveness for the Logistics Center in Incheon Port\'s Hinterland"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\uc6d0\uadfc(\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac)","\uc548\uc6c5(\uc11c\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc30\uc2b9\uad8c(\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 AHP \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc694\uc778 \ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uace0, \ud559\uacc4, \ubbfc\uac04, \uc815\ubd80\uad00\ub828 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uc785\uc8fc\ud55c \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uacfc \uc815\ucc45\uc218\ub9bd\uc790\uc640 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790 \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc774 \ub290\ub07c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b4\uc601\uc801\uc778 \uce21\uba74\uacfc \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \ucc3d\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \u201c\ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \ub0b4\ub959\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc5f0\uacc4\u201d\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \ubd80\ubb38\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc785\uc8fc\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc678\ubd80\uc758 \uc2dc\uac01\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uae09\ub418\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud488\ubaa9\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud488\ubaa9\uac04\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4\uc131\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ucc3d\ucd9c\uacfc \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc804\uccb4 \uc751\ub2f5\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub35c \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc785\uc8fc\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \uc804\uccb4 \uc751\ub2f5\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \uc778\uc2dd \ucc28\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud604\uc7ac \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac1c\uc120\uc5d0 \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uacb0\ub860\ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \uc704\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc218\ub9bd\uc790\uc640 \uc785\uc8fc \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uac00 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c\ud560 \uc815\ucc45\uc801\xb7\uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study builds a competitiveness factor model for the logistics centers in Incheon port\u2019s hinterland using an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and proposes to improve the added value and operating process of Incheon port\u2019s hinterland.

For instance, 99.7% of the volume of import and export cargoes in Korea has been handled by maritime transportation. The port logistics industry plays a significant role in the regional economic development of Korea by generating added value and employment. As of late, the Korean Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries formulates the port policy for developing specialized ports in harmony with the change of regional industries. Especially, the port logistics industry should be developed with regard to the relationship with regional linked industries. Such situation drives the need for an analysis of the regional economic impacts of the port logistics industry. Thus, this study attempts to explore the regional economic impacts of the port logistics industry using regional input-output (I-O) analysis focused on Busan, Incheon, and Ulsan.\\nWe use the original benchmark 2013 regional I-O tables obtained from the Bank of Korea. For port logistics-based analysis, original tables are aggregated into 4-region and 31-sector tables. Specifically, production, value-added, and employment inducing effects, as well as net trade in value-added are intimately presented. The analysis results reveal that the production inducing effects of the regional port logistics industry range from 1.7730 to 1.9783. Given that 65% of induced effects of logistics industry in Ulsan are generated from industries in this location, the industry is likely to be very dependent on industries in other regions. \u201cPort logistics,\u201d \u201cpetroleum and coal products,\u201d \u201cbusiness support services,\u201d \u201celectricity, gas, and steam supply,\u201d and \u201cwholesale and retail trade\u201d rank high in the sectoral inducing effects of port logistics. With regard to net trade in value-added, port logistics industries in Busan and Incheon generated positive values respectively, but the industry in Ulsan showed the opposite sign. It should be noted that net trade in value-added allows researchers to capture added values transferred during the production process contrary to value-added inducing effects.\\nAnalysis results will offer valuable information on the regional economic importance of port logistics industry for building the master development plan on nationwide ports. Especially, net trade in value-added will serve as a new indicator for describing the industrial status of the regional port logistics industry. In addition, this study can be applied to the design of efficient strategies for constructing the regional port logistics clusters. The sectoral linkages in a regional economy can provide the framework for identifying leading industries in the regional economy and for grouping the industries into spatial clusters. In light of academic research, introducing net trade in value-added using I-O analysis to the port logistics field for the first time will significantly contribute to expanding the range of the port logistics research. We expect this study to motivate future research with respect to the economic impacts of port logistics industry."}]},"fpage":"299","lpage":"320","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.299","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.002","citation-count":"25","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117512","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117485","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd88\ubcc0\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ubd84\ud574\uc640 \uc218\ucd9c\uc758 \ud328\ub110\uacf5\uc801\ubd84\ubca1\ud130 \ucd94\uc815"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Decomposition of Competitiveness of Gwangyang and Incheon Port with Constant Market Share Indices and Estimation of Panel Cointegrating Vectors on Exports"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Decomposition of Competitiveness of Gwangyang and Incheon Port with Constant Market Share Indices and Estimation of Panel Cointegrating Vectors on Exports"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ubaa8\uc218\uc6d0(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc740 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ud488\ubaa9\uacfc \uad50\uc5ed\ub300\uc0c1\uad6d\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294\ub2e4. \uc218\uc694\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \ud488\ubaa9\uc744 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \uadf8\ub807\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud55c \ud488\ubaa9\uc744 \uc8fc\ub85c \ub2e4\ub8e8\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \uac19\uc744 \uc218 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70, \uc218\uc785\uc218\uc694\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ube44\uc911\uc774 \ud070 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \uc815\uccb4\ub41c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc\uc758 \uad50\uc5ed\ube44\uc911\uc774 \ud070 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \ub2e4\ub97c \uc218\ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8\uace0\ub294 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uacfc \ud488\ubaa9 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ubd88\ubcc0\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud55c \ubd88\ubcc0\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uacfc \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubd84\ud574\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc9c0\uc218\uc5d0 \ud328\ub110\uacf5\uc801\ubd84\ubca1\ud130\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec GSE\uc640 PSE\uac00 \uad11\uc591\ud56d\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c\uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ud06c\uac8c \uae30\uc5ec\ud558\uba70, \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uc911\uad6d GSE\uac00 \uad11\uc591\ud56d \uc218\ucd9c\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc791\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc740 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc694\uc778\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub300\uc911\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uac1c\ucc99\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc778 \uc870\uce58\uac00 \uc808\uc2e4\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc1d\ud78c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The establishment of diplomatic relations with China in 1992 and the Chinese accession to the WTO in 2002 had been the most important events. In these years, the Korean foreign trade sector successfully specialised into product groups with a strongly growing demand. However, since 2001 the global economy has been changing. The world economy has to cope with rising raw material prices, including oil and agricultural products. As a consequence, shifts in income and demand changed the pattern of the global trade flows. Korea\u2019s geographical distribution of exports reflects its high degree of economic integration with the other industrial countries, especially the neighbouring China, Japan and the U.S. Korea\u2019s product specialisation reflects the importance of a few commodity groups, namely the group of machinery and vehicle products. However, the high geographical concentration and product specialisation of trade can be a source of vulnerability due to the sensitivity to cyclical fluctuations in the neighbouring countries and the U.S. In the last decade, the Gwangyang and Incheon ports also benefited from their location and from their specialisation. The two ports has suffered from cyclical fluctuations in the neighbouring countries. Changes of a port\u2019s market share in the exports of domestic ports result from many interrelated factors. Therefore, the analysis of the export performance of a port should be put in perspective by analysing long periods to identify trends. This paper aims to show the development of competitiveness, product and geographical structure of the merchandise exports of Gwangyang and Incheon Port from 2005 to 2015 using constant market shares (CMS) analysis. Constant market shares analysis is a technique for analysing trading patterns and trends for the purpose of policy formulation. The technique also allows one to evaluate why the exports of one port may grow faster than those of other ports. This may occur if the commodities a port exports experience a relatively rapid growth in world trade (the commodity composition effect). It may also happen when a port exports to partners with relatively high import growth (the country composition effect). Finally, an exporting port may increase its market share in the imports of specific commodities in the importing countries (the competitiveness effect). This paper is relevant for Gwangyang and Incheon port because their export market shares have been showing different paths. The dynamic consideration of the CMS analysis, which the static indicators have been replaced by time series, helps to track all changes in the export structure and competitiveness of the Gwangyang and Incheon port over time. This paper shows that the TE of Gwangyang Port is on the decrease recently, resulting from the falling PSE, while that of Incheon Port is increasing due to the rising GSE. The number of items with the PSE risen in Incheon Port is larger than in Gwangyang Port. The Panel Cointegrating Vector indicates that the GSE influences the export of both Gwangyang and Incheon Port positively but the former\u2019s GSE is smaller than the latter\u2019s one. The GSE is a negative factor for the export of Gwangyang Port but is a positive factor for the export of Incheon Port. This study also shows that the PSE affects the export of Gwangyang Port negatively, while the PSE does that of Incheon Port positively."}]},"fpage":"281","lpage":"297","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.281","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.007","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117485","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117452","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c DEA-AR/AHP \ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Feasibility Study of DEA-AR/AHP Model for Chinese Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Feasibility Study of DEA-AR/AHP Model for Chinese Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uad6c\uc885\uc21c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uac00\uc774\uc5b4\ub3d9(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"2008\ub144 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc804\uc138\uacc4 \ud574\uc0c1 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uac10\uc18c \ubc0f \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uce68\uccb4\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5 \uac04\uc758 \uce58\uc5f4\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc744 \uc57c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub610\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc81c\ud734\uc758 \ud655\ub300\ub97c \uac00\uc838\uc654\ub2e4. \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc81c\ud734\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud55c \uac70\ub300 \ud574\uc6b4\ub3d9\ub9f9\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0b4\uc544\ub0a8\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc81c\uace0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc911\uad6d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uace0, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc778 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5 \uac04 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uce21\uc815\uce58\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\uacb0\uc815\uc740 \uc911\uad6d \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5 \uc721\uc131\uc815\ucc45 \ub610\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uac1d\uad00\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ud3c9\uac00\uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uae30\ucd08\uc790\ub8cc\ub85c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c DEA-AR/AHP \ubd84\uc11d\ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 DEA-AR/AHP \uacb0\ud569\ubaa8\ud615\uc774 \uae30\uc874\uc758 DEA\ubaa8\ud615\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\ubc95\uc784\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The study attempts to analyze the efficiency of Chinese shipping companies using DEA-AR/AHP and to verify that this methodology is the most effective to analyze the efficiency of shipping companies compared to DEA(Data Envelopment Analysis), which is used for efficiency analysis in general. DEA has two models: CCR (Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes, 1978) and BCC (Banker, Charnes, and Cooper, 1984). This study compares the results both between CCR and CCR DEA-AR and between BCC and BCC DEA-AR. According to the empirical analysis, DEA-AR/AHP is very effective to analyze the efficiency compared to previous DEA methodology because it is possible to show the order of priority among shipping companies.\\nSome results of the empirical analysis and the implication are as follows.\\nFirst, the study verified the order of priority of 13 Chinese shipping companies through DEA-AR analysis. According to CCR-AR, only one company was effective throughout entire period (2009-2014) of analysis and other companies were not effective at all. Additionally, the difference in effectiveness between effective and ineffective shipping companies is too big. The results of BCC-AR also show that the effective number of shipping companies are 3, 3, 2, 2, 3, and 2 in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014 respectively. The number of effective shipping companies based on CCR-AR is smaller than the number of effective shipping companies based on BCC-AR, considering variable RTS (returns to scale).\\nSecond, according to the empirical results between DEA and DEA-AR/AHP, the number of effective shipping companies under BCC-AR is reduced twice or three times as much as it is in BCC. In the same way, the number of effective shipping companies in CCR-AR is reduced three or four times as much as it is in CCR. Based on this result, DEA-AR/AHP is more effective than previous DEA for the effective analysis of shipping companies.\\nMoreover, according to empirical analysis, some Chinese shipping companies still maintain high efficiency under what has become a challenging environment. The contribution of this study has been to provide objective evidence of Chinese shipping companies\u2019 competitiveness to policy-makers and thus encourage them to consider practical ways for the sustainable development of shipping companies. Moreover, the academic research in relation to Chinese shipping companies using DEA-AR/AHP methodology is still insufficient. It is absolutely necessary that academic research analyzes the situation and environment of shipping companies, and suggests strategies and policy to increase shipping companies\u2019 competitiveness.\\nThis study has some limitations with regard to the empirical analysis. This study uses general data and financial data to analyze efficiency due to the absence of data. However, it is better to consider other data such as capacity of operation, satisfaction, policies by shipping institutes or authority in order to verify the efficiency of shipping companies. Moreover, this study conducted the empirical analysis with smaller samples even though DEA analysis requires large DMUs for relative efficiency analysis; it also did not consider Chinese small-sized shipping companies. Therefore, in the future, we will attempt to conduct research related to the efficiency of small-sized shipping companies."}]},"fpage":"255","lpage":"279","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.255","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.001","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117452","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117438","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\uc81c\uad50\uc5ed\ud658\uacbd\ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud574\uc0c1\uad50\uc5ed\ud328\ud134 \ubcc0\ud654 \ubd84\uc11d - \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc8fc\uc694 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of changes in maritime trade patterns according to the changing international trade environment: the case of major container ports in Korea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of changes in maritime trade patterns according to the changing international trade environment: the case of major container ports in Korea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\ud638(\uad70\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc7a5\ud604\ubbf8(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uae40\uc0c1\uc5f4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae09\ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uad50\uc5ed\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc0b0, \uc778\ucc9c, \uad11\uc591\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 3\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uad6d\uc81c \ubb34\uc5ed\ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud574\uc0c1\uad50\uc5ed \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad50\uc5ed \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc911\ub825\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc \uccab\uc9f8, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc804\uccb4 \ud574\uc0c1 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uad50\uc5ed\ud328\ud134\uc740 \uad50\uc5ed\uad6d\uacfc\uc758 GDP \ub4f1 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uaddc\ubaa8\uc5d0 \ube44\ub840\ud558\uba70, \uac70\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ubc18\ube44\ub840\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uc8fc\uc694 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubcc4 \ud574\uc0c1 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uad50\uc5ed\ud328\ud134 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc804\uccb4 \ud574\uc0c1 \uad50\uc5ed\ud328\ud134\uacfc \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\uace0 \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc740 \uacbd\uc81c\ud1b5\ud569\uc778 ASEAN+3, NAFTA\uac00 \ubb34\uc5ed\ucc3d\ucd9c\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc740 NAFTA\uac00 (+)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In a rapidly changing trade environment, a variety of regional economic integrations and free trade agreements (FTAs) leading to a trade creation effect by eliminating the trade barriers, consequently increasing trade among member countries, or a trade diversion effect by reducing imports from non-member countries, are said to be of great importance to the fierce competition faced by major world ports to secure container volumes. In addition to the port competition between countries, domestic competition between ports is also getting severe within Korea. Therefore, this study aims to analyze the trade patterns of major Korean ports, including the ports of Busan, Incheon, and Gwangyang, by utilizing a gravity model, which can demonstrate the changes in maritime trade in accordance with the changing international trade environment. The gravity model developed in the 1960s is the most common formulation to predict bilateral trade flows based on economic variables including population, Gross Domestics Product (GDP), and the distance between countries. Despite its usefulness, it has been rarely employed in the maritime context. In the analysis, total container throughputs were used as the dependent variable, while per capita GDP, distance, and economic freedom were used as the explanatory variables. The economic integrations and FTAs, including the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Plus Three (ASEAN+3), 10 countries, plus Korea, China and Japan; the European Union (EU), 28 countries; the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), 3 countries; and the Mercado Com\xfan del Sur (MERCOSUR), 4 countries; were used as dummy variables.\\nAccording to the results of this study, first, it was found that the entire maritime container trade patterns in Korea are proportional to the overall market size of its trading partners, as measured by their GDP, while it is inversely proportional to the distance. In addition, ASEAN+3, one of the main regional economic integrations, has a positive effect on the maritime container trade, the so-called trade creation effect, while the EU, NAFTA and MERCOSUR have a negative effect on the maritime container trade; the so-called trade diversion effect. Second, the resulting analysis of maritime container trade patterns of each major port in Korea demonstrate that Busan Port shows results similar to the entire maritime trade patterns in Korea. In the case of Incheon Port, the economic integrations including ASEAN+3 and NAFTA are shown to have the trade creation effect with a positive effect on maritime container trade; whereas, the distance variable exerts a relatively larger impact than in both the Busan and Gwangyang ports, due to the trade structures concentrated in China and Southeast Asia. NAFTA is revealed to have a positive effect on maritime container trade and FTAs also have a positive effect on maritime container trade in Gwanyang port. These findings provide valuable insights for academics, managers as well as policy makers engaged in the port industry to develop strategies for obtaining container volumes."}]},"fpage":"239","lpage":"254","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.239","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.003","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117438","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117429","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc77c\ubcf8\ub300\ud615\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc804\ub7b5 \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Business strategy of Big Japanese Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Business strategy of Big Japanese Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ud55c\uc885\uae38(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae09\ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\ud658\uacbd \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacfc\uac70 \ubc31\ub144 \uc774\uc0c1 \uc138\uacc4 \ud574\uc6b4\uc5c5\uacc4\ub97c \uc120\ub3c4\ud558\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 2\ub300\uc120\uc0ac\uc778 \ub2c8\ud63c\uc720\uc13c\uacfc \uc1fc\uc13c\ubbf8\uce20\uc774\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc6b0\ub9ac \ud574\uc6b4\uc5c5\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc870\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. 2000\ub144\ub300\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\ud638\ud669\uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\uc131\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc218\uc775\uc131\uc744 MOL\uc774 \ucd94\uad6c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc0ac\uc5c5\ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc600\uc9c0\ub9cc 2009\ub144\ubd80\ud130 \uc2dc\uc791\ub41c \ud574\uc6b4\ubd88\ud669\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc7ac\ub3d9\uc870\ud654\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\\nNYK\uac00 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc740 \ub300\ud615\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ubd80\ubb38\uc774 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ub418\ub824\uba74 \uc721\ud574\uacf5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uccb4\uacc4\ub97c \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uace0 \ub458\uc9f8\ub85c \ubd80\uc815\uae30\uc120\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uc548\uc815\uc744 \ucd5c\uc6b0\uc120\uc2dc \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc601\uae30\uc870\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc885\ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \ub2e4\uc591\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc800\ube44\uc6a9\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uace0\ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58\ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc120\uc81c\uc801 \ud22c\uc790\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\uba70, MOL\uc774 \uc8fc\ub294 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc740 \ub300\ud615\uc120\uc0ac\ub294 \uc7a5\uae30\uc218\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uacbd\uc601\uc744 \ucd5c\uc6b0\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uc2dc\ud669\ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc88c\uc6b0\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uc2dc\ud669\uc608\uce21\ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \uae30\ub974\uace0 \ubb34\uc5c7\ubcf4\ub2e4\ub3c4 \ud638\ud669\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ub2e8\uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \uc7a5\uae30\uacc4\uc57d\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \ub300\ud615\ud22c\uc790\ub294 \uc808\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud53c\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study focuses on the business strategies of two big Japanese shipping companies, MOL (Mitsui Osaka Line) and NYK (Nihon Yusen Kaisha). These two companies have a long history of more than 150 years even though their competitors from developed countries such as SeaLand, Nedlloyds and Neptune Orients Line have disappeared. The objectives of this study are to analyze the business strategies of these two Japanese companies during shipping boom of the 2000\'s and to determine the factors that contribute to their survival.\\nThe shipping industry has known that there is a limitation for individual companies to expand their own unique strategy due to the nature of the service industry and the cyclical change of market. Japan\'s shipping industry has a long tradition to avoid competition among domestic rival because it undermines the stability of the market. Therefore, it is very hard to differentiate their business strategies from other members.\\nBy the 1963 shipping policy, the so-called Kaiun-shuyaku seisaku, formed the backbone of Japan\'s shipping market structure and functioned until now without considerable change. In other words, because of a strong shipping policy known as the convoy fleet policy, there was no room for individual companies to expand their own business strategies. If the failure of individual companies\u2019 unique business strategies always reside in the severe fluctuation of market, an individual company cannot expect any support from the Japanese government. Thus, it was common to harmonize the business strategies between the market\u2019s leading companies. MOL\'s annual sales amount is regularly changed to just 2/3 of its rival NYK from 1964 until now.\\nHowever, during the shipping boom period of the 2000\'s MOL moved its axis to profitability from stability of by choosing foreign spot market instead of traditional long term contract with Japanese shippers. Thus, the business portfolios of the two companies were changed. NYK increased the portion of its logistics business and MOL gave importance to bulk and energy-related contracts. Even though its gap in sales amount between two companies was not changed, profitability of MOL surpassed the leading company NYK. However, the recession of the shipping market resumed in 2009, and the coupling of the business strategy began.\\nSince shipping service is a commodity, severe cost cut is a common phenomenon. The implications of NYK\'s business strategy can be summarized as follows: Firstly, in order to vitalize the container shipping of the big shipping company, it is essential to establish a global multimodal transport system. Secondly, stability is a top priority for bulk shipping with diversification of the ship\'s portfolio and preemptive investments in high value added sectors that makes differentiation with a low cost carrier.\\nAn implication of MOL is as follows; Even though there is a different opinion that MOL has fully escaped from the crisis, MOL\'s way to escape the crisis gives provides us with suggestions. In the case of a large carrier, the top priority of management is to make a stable business based on long-term transport contracts, and to cultivate the ability to predict market so as be independent temporary market fluctuations. Above all, even as the economy is booming, large investment without guarantee of long term contract is absolutely avoid."}]},"fpage":"219","lpage":"238","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.2.219","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.2.010","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002117429","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"06","volume":"32","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002117422","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ucda9\uaca9\ubc18\uc751 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of the Stability and Impulse-Response of Shipping Lines in Korea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of the Stability and Impulse-Response of Shipping Lines in Korea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ud0dc\ud718(\ubc30\uc7ac\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc548\uc6b0\ucca0(\uac15\ub989\uc6d0\uc8fc\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc548\uc815\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc640 \uc120\uc0ac \uc601\uc5c5\uc774\uc775\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 10\uac1c \uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub9e4\ucd9c\uc561 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec VAR \ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ucda9\uaca9\ubc18\uc751\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218\uac00 \ub4f1\ub77d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70 2012~2013\ub144 \uae30\uac04, \uc2dc\ud669\uc758 \uc644\ub9cc\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\uc138\ub85c \uc9c0\uc218\uac00 \uae09\ub4f1\ud558\ub294 \uc120\uc0ac\ub3c4 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ucda9\uaca9\ubc18\uc751\ud568\uc218 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, BDI\uc758 \ucda9\uaca9\uc774 \uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc740 \uc791\uc558\uc73c\uba70 CCFI\ub294 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\uc740 \ucda9\uaca9\uc744 \uc8fc\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 HRCI\uc758 \ucda9\uaca9\uc740 \ub192\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc548\uc815\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\ud558\uace0 \uc0c1\uc704 10\uac1c \uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc758 \ucda9\uaca9\uc774 \uc120\uc0ac \ub9e4\ucd9c\uc561\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ucd94\uc801\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud559\ubb38\uc801 \uc758\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4\uace0 \ud558\uaca0\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The shipping industry suffered an important shock due to the merger of two prominent shipping lines, COSCO and China Shipping, in December 2015. It is important to prepare the exit strategy for the domestic shipping lines, Hajin Shipping (HIS) and Hyundai Merchant Marine (HMM), as the Korean financial authorities proposed the merger of HIS and HMM. As the shipping industry is a cycle industry, it is well known that the end of the depression should result in a boom for the industry. During a situation of balance between vessel supply and demand, the cargo volume positively affects the shipping rate; otherwise, the used vessels\u2019 price would be higher. The number of used vessels and newly built ones affects vessel oversupply, causing the shipping rate to be lower.\\nIn 2006, the shipping industry had undergone a large economic boom influenced by the Chinese special procurement demand and the global economic situation. As such, the Baltic Dry Index had increased from 773P on January 3, 2009, to 4,482P in November2009, and, subsequently, decreased to 1,594P in 2011. Due to the shipping recession triggered by the global financial crisis, most international and domestic shipping lines underwent severe liquidity risks, affecting the lines having stable profits, such as Korealines, STX-Pan Ocean, etc. During the recession, the future of the domestic lines was uncertain, because the lines\u2019 profits depend more on sea transport. In the profit structure, heavily dependent on transportation, as the ships sail more, the company incurs losses.\\nThere are several studies regarding the risk management of shipping lines. For example, Yoo (2008) researches risk management due to changing shipping rates. Na et al. (2015) weigh the priority factors, such as the market, operational, and financial perspectives, using an analytical hierarchy process (AHP) model. Using shock-resilience (S-R), Hwang et al. (2012) compare the performance of Korean and Japanese lines before and at the end of the recession. However, there is limited quantitative research on this matter. Therefore, this study generates a stability index for the lines and adopts an impulse response function to trace changes due to typical shipping indices, BDI, China Container Freight Index (CCFI), and the Howe Robinson Container Index (HRCI) during 11 years.\\nAs a result, the stability index would be higher or lower due to BDI, CCFI, and HRCI. Subsequently, the impulse of BDI is relatively smaller than the one of CCFI or HRCI.\\nThis study is similar to Kim (2014) and Kim et al. (2010), as it analyzes stability, profitability, productivity, growth, and change of the shipping lines\u2019 financial status.

PwC(2012) selected maritime industry as one of the future seven emerging industries. And recent study (2013) commissioned by European Commission estimated job creation in the 13 maritime sectors of EU member states that explained approximately 5 million jobs in 2004-2005. Ocean industry now seems as a critical economy engine due to the limitation of productive land resources, ecological exploitation and sustainability of the industry. Therefore, major ocean countries such as the USA, EU members, China have launched long-term strategy aimed for the development of ocean resources. In addition, these countries have periodically been collecting and publishing the ocean economy data thanks to the ocean industries\' enormous effect on entire national economy.\\nKorea, surrounded by the ocean on three sides, is also one of the major ocean countries, with 99.7% of international trade transported by the sea. And traditional ocean industries such as ship building, fishery, ocean shipping and seaport, have lead economy growth and will also be the critical component of national economy engine in the future. However, the interest and cognition of ocean industry is not very high to date due to the lack of systematic approach to the industry and related study.\\nThis study aims to re-categorize ocean industry with considering various related studies, estimate value added and calculate contribution to the national GDP for identifying related information of the Korean ocean industry.\\nWe estimated turnover and value-added of Korea\u2019s ocean industries that has re-categorized as 9 sectors in this paper with considering previous studies with data from Korea Statistical Information Service (KOSIS). This study used indirect method for estimating value-added owing to the limitation that none provided data from KOSIS about value-added in most ocean industry. Therefore, fundamental estimation way in this study is to apply value-added ratio that has published by Bank of Korea to the turnover data from 2010 economic census of Statistics Korea by each industry. Total turnover of ocean industry in 2010 is calculated to 165 trillion won and total value added is estimated to 43 trillion won in this study. The contribution ratio of ocean industry to the national GDP is calculated as 3.4 percent that is relatively higher than other major benchmarked ocean countries. While, value added ratio of ocean industry is estimated to 26.2 percent that is lowest level, compared with those countries. This means that the practical contribution of ocean industry to the national GDP is low while the ratio to the GDP is high. It is known that the technologies are the critical components to increase value-added ratio of ocean industry. Consequently, the result suggests that government have to increase critical technologies in the value chain for developing the Korean ocean industry."}]},"fpage":"161","lpage":"179","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.161","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.008","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091779","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091778","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc758 \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc57d\uad00 \uc124\uba85\uc758\ubb34\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Insurer\'s Duty of Explanation of Cargo Insurance Clauses in a Cargo Insurance Contract"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Insurer\'s Duty of Explanation of Cargo Insurance Clauses in a Cargo Insurance Contract"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc81c\ud604(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\uc601\ud6c8(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \uc900\uac70\ubc95 \ubb38\uc5b8\uc740 \uc900\uac70\ubc95\uc774 \uc601\uad6d\uc758 \ubc95\uacfc \uad00\uc2b5\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294\uc9c0 \ub610\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \ubc95\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ucda9\ub3cc\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \ucd08\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \uc601\uad6d\uc758 \ubc95\uacfc \uad00\uc2b5\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\uacb0\ud588\uace0 \uadf8 \uc774\ud6c4\uc5d0\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc57d\uad00\uaddc\uc81c\ubc95\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\uacb0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0(\ub300\ubc95\uc6d0 2001.7.27. \uc120\uace0 99\ub2e455533)\uc740 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud55c \uc0ac\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uc0c1\ubc18\ub41c \ud310\uacb0\uc744 \ub0b4\ub838\ub2e4. \uc57d\uad00\uaddc\uc81c\ubc95\uc744 \uc900\uac70\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\uacb0\ud55c \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc758 \ud310\ub840\ub97c \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc758 \uc900\uac70\ubc95\uc870\ud56d, \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \uc900\uac70\ubc95 \ubb38\uc5b8, \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc758 \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc57d\uad00 \uc124\uba85\uc758\ubb34, \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \ud611\ud68c\uc120\uae09\uc57d\uad00, \uc0c1\ubc95\uacfc \uc57d\uad00\uaddc\uc81c\ubc95\uc758 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc758 \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc740 \ud0c0\ub2f9\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcf8\ub2e4. \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0 \ud310\uacb0\uc758 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc740 \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc911\uc2ec\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ud5d8\uacc4\uc57d\uc790 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ubc95\ub9ac\uc801 \ud574\uc11d\uc774 \ubc14\ub00c\uace0 \uc788\uace0, \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc758 \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc57d\uad00 \uc124\uba85\uc758\ubb34\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc801\ud558\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\ub294 \uc774 \uc810\uc744 \uc720\uc758\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The institute clauses including \\"Notwithstanding anything contained here in or attached hereto to the contrary, this insurance is understood and agreed to be subject to English law and practice only as to liability for and settlement of any and all claims\\" are regularly include in cargo insurance contract throughout the world. A difference of opinion can arise as to the interpretation of the effectiveness of the English law and practice clauses in cargo insurance policy, as the institute clauses containing restrictive wording such as \\"only as to liability for and settlement of any and all claims\\". Under English law and practice, an insurer does not have a duty to explain and disclose important cargo insurance clauses to the assured even if the assured must disclose to the insurer, before the contract in concluded, every material circumstance which is known to the assured, and the assured is deemed to know every circumstance which, in the ordinary cours of business, ought to be known by him. Under the Korean Act for the Regulation of General Clauses, the Korean Commercial Code, the insurer has a duty to explain and disclose such important cargo insurance clauses to the assured. The insurer must disclose to the assured the cargo insurance clauses which determine whether the insurer will pay the claim amount. Therefore if the governing law of cargo insurance contract is English law and practice, an insurer may explain and disclose such important cargo insurance clauses to the assured in utmost good faith. These important cargo insurance clauses may be validly incorporated into a cargo insurance contract even if an insurer did not provide such explanation and disclosure and the insurer does not indemnify the assured for losses covered under such clauses. By contrast if the governing law is the aforementioned Korean Act for the Regulation of General Clauses, an insurer must provide such explanation and disclosure. If the insurer fails to make such disclosure, the assured may cancel the cargo insurance contract within one month from the date of entering into contract. If English law and practice were considered to unconditionally apply to every legal matter in cargo insurance, there would be several legal problems its interpretation. The Court does not unconditionally apply English law and practice to every legal matter in cargo insurance, and limits the range of its application to the liability for and settlement of any and all claims. The Court\'s interpretation is that the liability for and settlement of any and all claims is not the subject matter insured but is the establishment of a contract of a cargo insurance, that the institute classification clause is a special clause and the insurer must explain and disclose it. A contract of a cargo insurance is a contract whereby the insurer undertakes to indemnify the assured, in manner and to the extent thereby agreed, against marine losses, that is to say, the losses incident to marine adventure. The Korean Supreme Court\'s decisions based on the Korean Act for the Regulation of General Clauses are reasonable. The insurer must explain and disclose these special clauses to the assured. These special clauses is material which would influence the judgement of a prudent assured recovering a loss or determining whether the insurer will count the claim amount."}]},"fpage":"139","lpage":"159","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.139","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.001","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091778","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091777","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uacf5\uae09\ub9dd\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uac00\uce58\ud2b9\uc131\uacfc \uac70\ub798\uacf5\uc815\uc131 - \uad6c\ub9e4\ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\uc758 \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc774 \uac70\ub798\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Supply-chain Ethics and Transactional Justice - The Effect of Unethical Decision-Making in Purchasing on Transactional Justice and Logistics Performance -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Supply-chain Ethics and Transactional Justice - The Effect of Unethical Decision-Making in Purchasing on Transactional Justice and Logistics Performance -"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\uc591\uaddc(\uac74\uad6d\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ud558\ubcd1\ucc9c(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\ubbfc\uacbd(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\ub9dd \uc0c1\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \uae30\uc5c5 \uac04 \uac70\ub798\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uae09\uc790\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uac01\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6c\ub9e4\ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\uc758 \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \uc870\uc9c1\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ucc30\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc, \uad6c\ub9e4\ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790 \uac1c\uc778\uc774 \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uc808\ucc28\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ub2f9\uc704\uc131 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud574\uc11c \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \ud310\ub2e8\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0, \uac70\ub798\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c6\uc774 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \ubd80(-)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc2e4\uc131 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ub0b4\ub9ac\uac8c \ub418\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uac70\ub798\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc5d0 \ubd80(-)\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\ub098, \uac70\ub798\uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uad6c\ub9e4\ub2f4\ub2f9\uc790\uac00 \uac70\ub798 \uc0c1\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \uc724\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc758\ubb34\uac10, \uc0c1\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc30\ub824 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801 \uacc4\uc57d\uc758 \uc774\ud589\uc744 \uadfc\uac70\ub85c \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub418\uba74 \ubb3c\ub958\uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uac19\uc740 \uc870\uc9c1\uc131\uacfc\ub294 \uc800\ud574\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ud604\uc2e4\uc131\uc5d0 \uc785\uac01\ud55c \ube44\uc724\ub9ac\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc740 \uac70\ub798\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc744 \uc800\ud574\ud558\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc131\uacfc \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"According to the theory of justice, ethical decision-making by business organizations is the basis of the development of inter-organizational transactional justice. Several studies have proved that transactional justice affects supply chain management because it creates inter-firm trust and long-term collaborative relationships between supply chain partners. Consequently, ethics and transactional justice probably improve the performance of supply chains as well as the operational efficiency of the component firms.\\nThe primary purpose of this empirical study is to discover the meaningful causes of purchasing managers\u2019 unethical decision-making in supply-chain transactions. These are identified from a few philosophical concepts: ethics, morality, and virtue. Managers\u2019 unethical decision-making might ruin transactional justice between supply chain partner companies as well, and as such, the study uses a theoretical structural model to investigate the causal impact of purchasing managers\u2019 unethical supply-chain decision-making behaviors on both transactional justice and logistics performance. Moreover, the study attempts to prove the relationships between transaction justice and logistics performance, which might represent the overall operational performance of both the component firms and the supply-chain as a whole. That is, the structural causal relationships among managers\u2019 ethical levels, transactional justice, and logistics performance are tested in this research. In doing so, the study attempts to prove that purchasing managers\u2019 ethical approaches to their business partners and the consequential transactional justice affect supply chain management as firms seek continued collaborative relationships with business partners.\\nIn this study, the factors explaining the reasons for managers\u2019 unethical business decisions include the justifiability factor (i.e., oughtness or philosophical Sollen) and the pragmatism factor (i.e., practicalness or practicality). The justifiability factor includes the ethical dimensions of justice, deontology, and egoism. The pragmatism factor includes the ethical dimensions of utilitarianism and relativism. The study reveals that the justifiability factor has a significant negative impact on firm logistics performance but has no impact on transactional justice. Meanwhile, the pragmatism factor has a significant effect on transactional justice but has no impact on logistics performance. This implies that a manager\u2019s unethical decision-making behaviors stemming from disregard for fairness, consideration for business partners, or fulfillment of social contract, might ruin firm performance. On the other hand, a manager\u2019s unethical decision-making caused by overweight preference for the consequential effect, efficiency improvements, or profit maximization, might worsen transactional justice with business partners. Therefore, firms need to balance the justifiability factor and the practicality factor when making ethical decisions. Such an approach is likely to improve transactional justice, the firms\u2019 business performance, and the collaborative relationships with suppliers."}]},"fpage":"111","lpage":"137","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.111","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.005","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091777","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091776","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uacf5\ub3d9\ub3c4\ub9e4\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Efficiency Analysis for Competitiveness of Common Logistics Centers for Small Retailers in South Korea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Efficiency Analysis for Competitiveness of Common Logistics Centers for Small Retailers in South Korea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\uccad\ub9bc(\ud55c\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubb38\uc0c1\uc601(\ud55c\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc815\ubd80\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub300\uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uc881\ud788\uae30 \uc704\ud574 10\uc5ec \ub144\uac04 \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uacf5\ub3d9\ub3c4\ub9e4\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uac74\ub9bd\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub178\ub825\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. 2003\ub144\ubd80\ud130 \uad6d\ube44 711\uc5b5\uc6d0\uc774 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub418\uc5b4 2015\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 41\uac1c\uc18c\uac00 \uac1c\uc124 \ubc0f \uad6c\ucd95 \uc911\uc774\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ubbf8\ud761\uc73c\ub85c 2013\ub144 \uae30\uc900 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ub41c 23\uac1c \uc13c\ud130 \uc911 7\uac1c\uc18c\uac00 \uc601\uc5c5\uc801\uc790 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uac74\ub9bd \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \uc9c0\uc801\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uc5c5 \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654, \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uc5c5\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810, \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uacf5\ub3d9\ub3c4\ub9e4\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf8 \ud6c4 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uccad\uc5d0\uc11c \uc815\ubcf4\uacf5\uac1c\ub97c \uccad\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec \ucde8\ub4dd\ud55c 19\uac1c \uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc790\ub8cc\ub85c DEA\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc Malmquist\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uacf5\ub3d9\ub3c4\ub9e4\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc758 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc0b0\ucd9c\uc694\uc18c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud22c\uc785\uc694\uc18c\uac00 \uacfc\ub300\ud55c \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc911\uc18c\uc720\ud1b5\uacf5\ub3d9\ub3c4\ub9e4\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In this study, the efficiency and productivity of common logistics centers for small and medium-size retailers in South Korea are analyzed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) and a Malmquist productivity index (MPI). Nonpublicly available data from 2010 to 2013 obtained from government agencies are analyzed to reveal the operational and policy implications of the development of such centers. Since small and medium-size retailers weaken their competitiveness compare to new and large retailers such as online shopping and super supermarket, development of the common logistics centers has been issued. Typically, these common logistics centers are introduced to enhance the competitiveness of small and medium-size retailers. The new and large retailers are able to enhance efficiency through economies of scale, especially in supply chain management. They can handle, transport, and store more goods at a relatively low unit cost since they can manage a large amount of goods using enhanced information and communication technology (ICT) services.However, small and medium-size retailers lack access to such technology, which is used to improve operational efficiency, because of the large initial investment required. Hence, common logistics centers are introduced to enable many small retailers to store and handle their goods together and thus achieve economies of scale. These centers facilitate common logistics operations including planning, development, and display of products as well as their storage, distribution, and packaging. Further, the centers provide educational and training services regarding.\\nAs of 2015, there are 41 such centers, including 11 under construction. The centers are relatively small in size since only 9 centers are larger than 3,300\u33a1. In particular, 22 centers were constructed from 2012 onward following increasing government support. This is mainly because social interest increased owing to the weakening competitiveness of small retailers and the steady increase in the number of super supermarkets that directly compete with small retailers by adopting a similar competitive strategy.\\nThe analysis results show that efficiency of the common logistics centers show upward trend. However, it seems that this is mainly because of increases in technology development rather than technical efficiency. The concept of technical efficiency is based on input-output relationships. This results can be used to identify alternatives for investment in capability development of the common logistics centers, which may include both services and infrastructure. Technical efficiency change, technical change, and efficiency change are important sources of production growth in the common logistics centers. These centers enable small retailers to achieve reduced operating costs and increased revenues and to focus on their core competence. Empirical results show that scale inefficiency is the major reason for inefficient decision-making units because lack of number of products may negatively influence output variables. Therefore, the common logistics centers need to analyze needs of customers and develop operational strategy which is customer-driven."}]},"fpage":"91","lpage":"109","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.91","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.007","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091776","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091775","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud0dc\ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis of the Logistics Information Service of Incheon Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis of the Logistics Information Service of Incheon Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ucc28\uc601\ub450(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\uacbd\uc601\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)","\uac15\uc601\uc6b0(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ud64d\uac78(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc815\ubcf4\ud654\uc758 \uc9c4\uc804\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0, \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958 \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc2e4\ud0dc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc218\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud06c\uac8c 2\uac00\uc9c0 \uce21\uba74\uc758 \uc2e4\ud0dc \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\uc120, \uc911\uc694\ub3c4-\ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uae30\ubc95(IPA)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \uc815\ubcf4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \ud1b5\ud569\ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ud1b5\ud569\uc815\ubcf4\uc81c\uacf5\uc218\uc900, \uc815\ubcf4\uc870\ud68c\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131, One-STOP \uc815\ubcf4\uc81c\uacf5 \uc218\uc900, \uc624\ub958\uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ucc98\ub9ac \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4, \uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\uc120\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548\uc774 \uc218\ub9bd\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c, \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac \ubc0f \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ud3ec\ud138\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc758 \uc6f9 \uae30\ub2a5\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc, \uc6f9 \uc811\uadfc\uc131 \uc9c0\uce68\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc900\uc218\uc728\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, 2\uac00\uc9c0 \ubaa8\ub450 60%\ub300\ub85c\uc11c, \ubbf8\ud761\ud55c \uc218\uc900\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc6f9 \uc131\ub2a5 \ucd5c\uc801\ud654 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ud3ec\ud138\uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ub0ae\uc740 \ub4f1\uae09\uc778 F\ub4f1\uae09\uc744 \ubc1b\uc544 \uc774 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc120\ucc45 \ub9c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Advances in information and communication technologies have made the Internet and mobile devices popular media in both the business world and in daily life. These technologies are widely recognized as indispensable tools for all activities.\\nA port is operated on the basis of information about cargos and ships, and hence port operations rely significantly on information and communication technologies. The information services that a port provides are essential services for port users, including shipping and inland transportation companies. Moreover, due to rapid changes in the world trade and shipping environment, today\u2019s ports face ever-increasing competition from adjacent ports. Thus, the provision of good information services for port users has been recognized as an important strategy for maintaining port competitiveness. However, despite its importance, there has been little research on the current status and utilization of the port-logistics information service based on a field survey. The aim of this paper is to analyze the actual status of the port-logistics information service that Incheon port provides. Towards this objective, we conducted Importance-Performance Analysis (IPA) and evaluated the port\u2019s website functionality.\\nIPA is an evaluation tool that is used to prioritize attributes for improvement and that can also provide guidance for strategic development. For IPA, 17 evaluation items from previous related studies were adopted and data was collected from port-logistics companies that use information services provided by Incheon port. For the evaluation of website functionality, we used K-WAH(Korean-Web Accessibility Helper) and YSLOW. K-WAH is a representative tool to estimate web accessibility. YSLOW is a tool used to estimate the level of web-optimization, and comprises 35 evaluation items, including usage of a content delivery network, Gzip components, and making Java Scripts and CSS external. The results of the empirical data analysis revealed that there are gaps between overall importance and satisfaction of information service. Especially, it highlighted that Incheon port had several weak points: unification of information through database integration, one-stop information service, variety of information, and prompt dispatch of error information.\\nBased on the evaluation of website functionality, it was found that the homepage and portal of Incheon port had several problems. Both the websites\u2019 accessibility compliance rate in accordance with K-WAH was less than 70%, implying low levels of web accessibility. In the web-optimization analysis, Incheon port\u2019s portal obtained a very low, F grade, implying that it has serious problems with processing a variety of user requirements in information service. As the information volume rapidly increases, the loading speed of the website becomes much slower. In order to solve this problem, it is necessary to optimize the website."}]},"fpage":"69","lpage":"90","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.69","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.006","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091775","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091774","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \uac1c\uccb4 \ubcd1\ud569 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc601\uc5ed \ucd94\ucd9c \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Study on Extracting Container Code Region by Merging Labeling Objects"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Study on Extracting Container Code Region by Merging Labeling Objects"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ucd5c\ucc3d\ud6c8(\uacbd\ubd81\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc31\uc2b9\uad00(\uacbd\ubd81\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc778\uc2dd \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ucc98\ub9ac \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc601\uc5ed \ucd94\ucd9c\uacfc\uc815\uc774 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc774\ub97c \ubaa8\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0(Morphology) \uc5f0\uc0b0\uacfc \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1 \uac1c\uccb4 \ubcd1\ud569 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc785\ub825\ub41c \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\uc120 \uc601\uc0c1 \uc804\uccb4 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc601\uc5ed \ubd84\ud560\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucf54\ub4dc\ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uc788\uc744\ub9cc\ud55c \ubd80\ubd84\ub9cc\uc744 \ub0a8\uae30\uace0 \uc601\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uceec\ub7ec\uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8\ub808\uc774 \uc601\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud658\ud55c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 4\uac00\uc9c0\uc758 \ubaa8\ud3f4\ub85c\uc9c0(Morphology) \uc5f0\uc0b0\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc601\uc0c1\uc744 \uc0dd\uc131\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc0dd\uc131\ub41c 4\uac1c\uc758 \uc601\uc0c1\uc744 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\uccb4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574\ub0b4\uace0 \uc601\uc0c1\uacfc \uac1c\uccb4\uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc7a1\uc74c\uc744 \uc81c\uac70\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ud6c4 \ub77c\ubca8\ub9c1\ub41c \uac1c\uccb4\ub4e4\uc744 \ubcd1\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ucf54\ub4dc \uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574\ub0b8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ud5d8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc720\ud6a8\uc601\uc5ed \ube44\uc728\uc774 \ub2e8\uc21c \uc601\uc5ed \ucd94\ucd9c \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Container code recognition is a technology that uses cameras to automatically recognize and separate the container codes engraved on the front, side, rear, and top surfaces of containers entering the container treatment plant. Often, the code is not visible due to movement or contact between containers and even accurate RFID systems fail in recognizing the code. Matching the RFID inputs and the actual codes requires time and labor; however, automating this operation using camera recognition can save both time and money, as extracting the container code region is an important intermediate process.\\nThis study proposes an extraction technique for container code regions, which can be used in the container image recognition system. The container code is painted in different formats for each container; therefore, pre-processing when extracting the container code region is extremely important. The first pre-processing step is applying the container image to the region division. We calculate the ratio of the total image size and the vertical rod size of the container from the input container image. Further, we apply the region division by using the calculated ratio and remove the vertical rods in the input container image to leave only the image part of the code. Then, the container image region division is converted into a gray image to apply the morphology operation.\\nBinarization\u2014through the process of analyzing the image\u2014may be less efficient in the following code recognition process. Therefore, applying the four operations of morphology highlights the code image of the container; however, the image is not uniform as it is obtained outdoors. We do not use a global thresholding method, as it does not generate a clear container binary image. Instead, we use an adaptive thresholding method to determine the binary value using the threshold values of each part of the container image. Further, the labeling technique is applied to each of the four binary images to extract the object and we remove noise in the images by considering the ratio between the image and the labeling objects. We store the labeling objects in a linked list and check whether each labeling object overlaps by examining the coordinates of objects stored in the linked list. Finally, we generate the container code region through the code recognition input by merging the overlapping objects.\\nThe number of valid regions through our technique is higher than the simple extraction method and might be effective in next generation of container code recognition systems."}]},"fpage":"49","lpage":"67","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.49","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.003","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091774","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091773","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc720\ub77c\uc2dc\uc544 \u9435\u9053\u7d93\u8def\uc640 \u570b\u969b\u6d77\u904b\u7d93\u8def\uc758 \u6642\u7cfb\uf99c\u7684 \u7af6\u722d\u529b\uc5d0 \u95dc\ud55c \u784f\u7a76"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Competitive Analysis of the Trans-Siberian Railway and All Water Transport Routes"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Competitive Analysis of the Trans-Siberian Railway and All Water Transport Routes"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc870\uc9c4\ud589(\ud55c\ub77c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \uc720\ub77c\uc2dc\uc544\ucca0\ub3c4\uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uac80\ud1a0\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uba74 \uccab\uc9f8, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \uae30\uc810 \uc720\ub7fd \uc8fc\uc694\ub3c4\uc2dc \uac04 TSR\uc911\uc2ec \uad6d\uc81c\ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\uc640 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc911\uc2ec \uad6d\uc81c\ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\uc758 \ub4f1\uac00\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc120(iso-competitiveness line)\uc740 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud070 \ubcc0\ub3d9 \ud3ed\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud654\uc8fc\ub4e4\uc740 \uc720\ub77c\uc2dc\uc544 \uad6d\uc81c\ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c \uc120\ud0dd \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ubcf4\uac00 \uc81c \ub54c\uc5d0 \uc81c\uacf5\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc720\ub77c\uc2dc\uc544\ucca0\ub3c4\ub294 \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900 \uc99d\ub300, \ud2b9\ud788 \uadf9\ub3d9\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ud22c\uc790 \uc99d\ub300 \ubc0f \ud654\ucc28\ubd80\uc871 \ubb38\uc81c \ud574\uacb0 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ub178\ub825\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4.\\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uacfc \uc720\ub7fd \ub0b4\ub959 \ub3c4\uc2dc \uac04 TSR\uc911\uc2ec \uad6d\uc81c\ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc218\ub2e8\uacfc \uad6d\uc81c\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc911\uc2ec \uad6d\uc81c\ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc218\ub2e8\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \ucd5c\ucd08\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc694\uc728\uacfc \uc6b4\uc1a1\uae30\uac04\uc774 \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uba74\ub2f4\uc774 \ubcf4\uc870\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc84c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study analyzes the competitiveness of international multimodal transport by comparing the Trans-Siberian Railway (TSR) with all modes of water transport between Busan Port and European inland cities, using various methodologies including tariff rates, transit times, and interviews. as well as data collected through interviews were used in the study. This is the first study to adopt a dynamic time series analysis, by reviewing historical data for 1998, 2005, and 2013, unlike earlier studies that analyzed international modal transport choice in the Eurasian continent without specific timeframes. Interview method for an international freight forwarder, SJ Logistics Group, was adopted to supplement the study.\\nThe study\u2019s findings are as follows. First, from Busan, the TSR route tariff rate for Moscow and Hamburg port increased approximately 1.6 times between 1998 and 2013, but the corresponding transit time fell by 30%. By contrast, the international sea transport tariff rate fell by 30%, whereas the transit time increased by 35%. These findings imply that the TSR is competitive in terms of service quality in transit time, and the international sea transport mode, in terms of price. Three facts support this conclusion. First, the TSR tariff rate has increased significantly since 2006. Second, the international sea transport mode can absorb the rate hike factors by mega-carrier trends, the keen competition among shipping companies. Finally, marine freight demand has remained below its lowest level owing to the decline and oversupply of shipping services since 2008. The second finding is that the iso-competitive line between the TSR and all the water transport modes shows significant variability in the time series for the Moscow line (1998), Munich-Budapest line (2005), and Nizhny novogorod line (2013; 1,000km east from Moscow). Third, the variability of this iso-competitive line is dependent upon the tariff rates of international liner ships, mega-carrier trends, keen service competition among shipping companies, and TSR transit times and service levels. Therefore, Eurasian continental shippers between Korea and West European cities (ranging from Moscow to harbor port cities such as Rotterdam and Hamburg), should receive correct information on tariffs and services, such as data on service reliability, safety, custom clearance, and wagon supply.\\nFinally, the modal choice of the Eurasian continental relies on tariff rates, transit times, and customer service. The TSR improved its transit time considerably, although it increased its tariff rates. Therefore, selecting the TSR mode would mitigate the port congestion problem in Far Eastern ports such as Vladivostok, Vostochny, and Nakhodka; address the wagon shortage in peak season; simplify clearance issuance and administrative procedures; control volatility caused by unilateral rate hikes without advance notice; and improve the standard of service in the pilferage, loss, and cargo information system. The limitation of this study is that service reliability and safety were not taken into account in the international multi-modal choice model."}]},"fpage":"29","lpage":"47","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2016.32.1.29","uci":"G704-000463.2016.32.1.004","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002091773","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2016","pub-mon":"03","volume":"32","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002091772","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uadf8\ub79c\uc800 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc138\uacc4 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ubc1c\uc8fc\ub7c9\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uc6b4\uc784\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Study on Correlation between the Shipbuilding Order Quantity of Major Shipping Liners and Maritime Freight Rates: Using Granger Causality Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Study on Correlation between the Shipbuilding Order Quantity of Major Shipping Liners and Maritime Freight Rates: Using Granger Causality Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc804\uae30\uc815(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc591\ucc3d\ud638(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 \uc0c1\uc704 10\ub300 \uc815\uae30 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \ud55c\uc9c4\ud574\uc6b4, \ud604\ub300\uc0c1\uc120\uc758 \uc2e0\uc870\ubc1c\uc8fc \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uc6b4\uc784\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc6b4 \uc120\uc0ac\ubcc4 \ud22c\uc790\uc720\ud615\uc744 \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub41c \ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \uc138\uacc4 10\ub300 \uc815\uae30 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \ud55c\uc9c4 \ud574\uc6b4, \ud604\ub300 \uc0c1\uc120\uc758 2005\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2014\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ubc1c\uc8fc\ub7c9(TEU)\uc774\uba70, \ud574\uc6b4\uc6b4\uc784\uc740 BDI, CCFI, HRCI\ub97c \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub79c\uc800 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\uc640 \ucda9\uaca9\ubc18\uc751\ud568\uc218\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ubcc4 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uc720\ud615\uc740 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \uad6c\ubd84\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \u2018\uc2dc\ud669\ud750\ub984 \ubb34\uad00 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\u2019\ud615\uc758 Maersk, \u201c\uc2dc\ud669\uc0c1\uc2b9\uae30 \uc774\uc804 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\u201d \ud615\uc758 China Shipping, COSCO, OOCL, \u2018\uacfc\ub2e4\ubc1c\uc8fc\uc5d0 \ub3d9\ucc38 \ud6c4 \uc2dc\ud669\ud558\ub77d\u2019\ud615\uc758 MSC, CMA-CGM, APL, UASC, Hapag-Lloyd, OOCL, Hanjin Shipping, Hyundai M.M, \u201c\uc2dc\ud669\uc0c1\uc2b9\uae30 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790 \ud68c\ud53c\u201d \ud615\uc758 MSC, CMA-CGM, Evergreen, APL\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study aimed to analyze the correlation between the shipbuilding order strategies of the top 10 global regular-container shipping companies, Hanjin shipping, Hyundai M.M and shipping charges. While Maersk, the global leading container shipping company, places shipbuilding orders before a rise in market conditions, most Asian shipping companies place shipbuilding orders when market conditions are at a peak, thus worsening business difficulties during an extended recession in the shipping industry. Based on these analysis results, the ship investment types of shipping companies were analyzed as well.\\nThe data used in this study included the ship order quantities of Hanjin Shipping, Hyundai Mrechant Shipping and global top 10 container shipping companies, as well as BDI, CCFI, HRCI. The data of the Alphaliner\u2019s report were used for the shipbuilding order quantities of these companies while the data for CCFI, BDI, and HRCI were obtained from the Korea Maritime Institute. For the period between 2005 and 2014, every three to five months of collected data had been used, in conjunction with Granger casuality test, to analyze the correlation between shipbuilding oreder quantities and maritime freight rates.\\nThe ship investment types of shipping companies were classified through the Granger causality analysis and the impulse response function as follows. The shipping companies that did not exchange influence with any shipping charge were Maersk. This group is the \'ship investment irrelevant to market trend\' type who makes ship investments based on business judgment that is different from the market trend. The group whose ship order quantity has a positive influence on the shipping charge indicates that they order ships before a rise of shipping charge, which can be called the \'ship investment before market rise\' type. The analysis results of this study showed that this group of the \'ship investment before market rise\' type included China Shipping, COSCO and OOCL.\\nThe group whose ship order quantity had a negative influence on shipping charge included MSC, CMA-CGM, APL, UASC, Hapag-Lloyd, Hyundai, and Hanjin. This group can be called the \'market decline after participation in excessive orders\' type, meaning that they invested in ships trusting the current market condition, but the shipping charge decreased after the investment. The shipping companies whose ship order was positively influenced by shipping charge did not exist. This group can be called the \'market-following ship investment\' type, meaning that they increased ship orders when the shipping charge was high. The group whose ship order was negatively influenced by shipping charge can be called the \'avoidance of ship investment during market rise\' type, meaning that they reduced ship orders when the shipping charge was high.

Port shutdowns caused by unexpected phenomena such as natural disasters, port labor strikes, and technological accidents can generate negative impacts on the entire national economy, as inputs for intermediate and final consumption cannot be transported, causing disruptions down the supply chain, while exports for foreign markets are obstructed, causing production disruptions up the supply chain. Given that the spill-over effects of a port shutdown involve potential losses, an explicit estimate of such impacts can serve as a reference point in strategic planning for port safety.\\nIn this regard, this study analyzed economic impacts of the port shutdown using input-output analysis (i.e. demand-driven and supply-driven models). Specifically, Ulsan Port was selected as the research object with regard to port throughput and the probability of diversion routes. Moreover, according to International Energy Agency (IEA) members\u2019 oil-reserve rules, the period of the port shutdown was meant to not exceed three months. The impacts of the port shutdown directly refer to the impacts of import, export, and on-site port operation disruptions. Production, added value, employee pay, and employment numbers were considered as measures of economic impacts of the port shutdown. Analysis results reveal that a three-month total shutdown of Ulsan Port induced a large drop in production of \u201cpetroleum and coal products,\u201d \u201ctransportation equipment,\u201d and \u201cchemicals and allied products,\u201d and an overall reduction of 1.1% in GDP. In particular, if Ulsan Port is completely disrupted for three months, employment rates in the Ulsan region will drop by as much as 10.6% as production would decline in many industries.\\nGiven the significant negative impacts of a port shutdown, the development of a port risk management system for safety and resilience is surely necessary. Accordingly, analysis results will offer critical information on the risk benefits of constructing such a system, which can be measured by multiplying the estimates of negative impacts by the probability of a shutdown accident. We combined trade statistics from the transportation mode recorded by the Korea Customs Service with a regional input-output table, which allowed us to generate detailed maritime export and import data by industry. Such combination of input-output tables with another relevant source may enlarge the range of application of inter-industry analysis. By empirically exploring the economic impacts of the Korean port shutdown for the first time, this study will contribute to expanding the scope of port logistics research. Finally, we expect that the results will provide the Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries with overarching information for formulating policies to address port safety issues."}]},"fpage":"839","lpage":"861","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.4.839","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.4.001","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002061789","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"12","volume":"31","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002061773","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"DEA-Window \ubc0f Malmquist \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc608\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of the Efficiency and Productivity of Tug Boat Companies using DEA-Window and the Malmquist Index"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of the Efficiency and Productivity of Tug Boat Companies using DEA-Window and the Malmquist Index"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc591\uc218(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc804\uc900\uc6b0(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\ucc28\uc601\ub450(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\uacbd\uc601\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DEA-Window \ubc0f Malmquist \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 2009\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2013\ub144\uac04 \uc608\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\xb7\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\xb7\ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d\uc758 \uc608\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4 20\uac1c\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud22c\uc785\ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \uc9c0\ucd9c\ube44, \ub9c8\ub825, \uc720\ub958\ube44\ub97c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc0b0\ucd9c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c\ub294 \ub9e4\ucd9c\uc561\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Considering input and output variables used in previous studies, as well as towing service companies\u2019 unique features, we identified costs (labor costs, financing costs, operating expenses, and depreciation costs), horsepower, and oil expenses as input variables, and sales revenue as the output variable. The efficiency analysis examined towing service companies at Busan, Incheon, and Pyoungtaek ports. The three ports were selected for comparative analysis because they adopted different operation methods (cooperative ship operation for Busan port, cooperative ship operation and limited permits for Incheon port, and free contracts for Pyoungtaek port).\\nTo analyze towing service companies\u2019 dynamic efficiency at the three ports, a DEA-Window analysis was conducted with a window width of 3. The results showed a steady decline in efficiency at all three ports between 2009 and 2012, but an improvement in 2013. As for year-specific efficiency at the three ports, efficiency at Busan port fell in 2012, and did not recover in 2013, thereby falling behind Incheon port. Incheon port\u2019s towing service companies had operated less efficiently than those at other ports, but their efficiency was the highest in 2013. Pyoungtaek port\u2019s towing service companies were the most efficient in 2009, but their efficiency deteriorated afterwards, and these became least efficient despite an improvement in 2013.\\nThe Malmquist index was used to analyze towing service companies\u2019 productivity at Busan, Incheon, and Pyoungtaek ports. As for Busan port, productivity rose by 3.7% to 1.037 in 2009\u201310, declined by 0.1% to 0.999 in 2010\u201311, and further declined by 6.7% to 0.933 in 2011\u201312. It fell by 0.9% to 0.991 in 2012\u201313, and for the entire period, productivity declined, on average, by 0.990 or 1% each year. At Pyoungtaek port, productivity fell by 9.2% to 0.908 in 2009\u201310, dropped by 11% to 0.894 in 2010\u201311, fell by 14% to 0.859 in 2011\u201312, and then improved by 16.6% to 1.166 in 2012\u201313. For the entire period, productivity declined, on average, by 0.957 or 4.3% annually. At Incheon port, productivity dropped by 0.1% to 0.999 in 2009\u201310, fell by 6.9% to 0.931 in 2010\u201311, then sharply rose by 81% to 1.806 in 2011\u201312, and increased by 14.7% to 1.147 in 2012\u201313. For the entire period, productivity improved, on average, by 1.220 or 22% each year.\\nThe Malmquist index-based analysis showed that productivity gradually deteriorated for towing service companies at Busan and Pyoungtaek ports, but improved at Incheon port. Efficiency at Busan port increased slightly by 1.006 or 0.6% between 2009 and 2013, and their technology level dropped 0.997 or 0.3% each year over the same period. Efficiency at Pyoungtaek port decreased by 0.968 or 3.2% between 2009 and 2013, and their technology level increased by 1.004 or 0.4% over the same period. Technical efficiency at Incheon port increased by 1.197 or 19.7% between 2009 and 2013, and their technology level dropped 0.999 or 0.1% over the same period."}]},"fpage":"813","lpage":"837","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.4.813","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.4.003","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002061773","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"12","volume":"31","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002061757","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\xb7\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac\uc120\uc0ac \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of the Importance Factors for Choosing Korea-China Car Ferry Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of the Importance Factors for Choosing Korea-China Car Ferry Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\uc131\uc740(\uc528\ub808\uc778\ubcf4\uc6b0\uc778\ud130\ub0b4\uc154\ub110(\uc8fc))","\uc774\ucda9\ud6a8(\ud55c\uad6d\uc218\uc790\uc6d0\uacf5\uc0ac)","\uae40\ud615\uc77c(\uc778\ucc9c\ud5a5\ub9cc\uc5f0\uc218\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\xb7\uc911\uac04 FTA \uccb4\uacb0, \uc5ed\uc9c1\uad6c \ub4f1 \ud55c\xb7\uc911\uac04 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc758 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\uac00 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\uc758 \ubaa8\uc0c9 \uc5c6\uc774\ub294 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \uc5c5\uacc4\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac\uc120\uc0ac \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc744 \uacc4\uce35\ud654\ub41c AHP \uc124\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ud3ec\uc6cc\ub354 \uadf8\ub8f9\uacfc \ud654\uc8fc \uadf8\ub8f9\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc30d\ub300\ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub450 \uadf8\ub8f9\uc758 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac\uc120\uc0ac \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc778\uc2dd\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694\uc778\uc740 \uc2e0\uc18d\uc131 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b4\ud56d\uc2dc\uac04, \ub0b4\ub959\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc694\uae08, \ud558\uc5ed\ub8cc, \uc6b4\ud56d\uc758 \uc815\uc2dc\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud654\uc8fc \uc785\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\uc2dc \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e0\uc18d\uc131\uc758 \uc6b4\ud56d\uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uad50\uc6b0\uc704 \uac15\uc870 \ubc0f \uac04\uc774\ud1b5\uad00 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub4f1\uc758 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \ubcf4\uc644\uc774 \ubcd1\ud589\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uace0, \uce74\ud398\ub9ac\uc120\uc0ac \uc785\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc784 \uac1c\uc120\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc77c\ubc18\ud654\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc720\uce58 \ub178\ub825\ub3c4 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The quantity of goods transported from China is expected to rise drastically, given the recent conclusion of the free trade agreement between Korea and China and the rise of online purchases of Chinese customers on Korean Internet sites. The rising e-commerce is good news, but it may not last long if the problems affecting the car ferry routes between Korea and China are not resolved and measures not taken to enhance the competitiveness of shipping companies. To enhance competitiveness, the strength of the car ferry shipping between Korea and China should be analyzed and issues such as the imbalanced supply and demand between Korea and China, severe freight rate war, backlash against the protective policies of car ferry routes, lack of competitiveness, and deterioration of shipping should be resolved.\\nTo help strengthen competitiveness in the car ferry shipping between Incheon and Tianjin, this study conducted a survey on freight forwarders and shippers with intent to provide an empirical analysis.\\nThus, a preliminary research was conducted to draw up a survey questionnaire. The upper category reasons listed for choosing a certain car ferry shipping company were speed, economic feasibility, and stability. Speed was then subdivided into shipping time, cargo working time, and customs clearance time; economic feasibility was subdivided into ocean freight charge, unloading charge, and inland haulage charge; and stability was subdivided into low damage rate of freight, safety facility for freight inside the ship, and punctuality of sailing.\\nFrom the classified Analytic Hierarchy Process survey analysis, the elements that showed significant differences in perceptions of the forwarders, distribution service providers, shippers, and distribution service users were speed and economic feasibility in the upper category elements and shipping time, inland haulage charge, unloading charge, and punctuality of sailing in the sub-category elements.\\nIn conclusion, car ferry shipping companies in the Incheon-Tianjin route need to change their strategy: they need to raise the satisfaction level of the elements viewed important by forwarders and shippers, maintain the satisfaction level of the elements low in significance, and focus on their core abilities. As for the important elements for shippers, namely, speed in the upper category and shipping time in the sub-category, car ferry shipping companies should promote more active marketing to highlight their competitiveness relative to general container shipping and emphasize the economic and speed aspects of car ferry shipping in physical distribution.\\nTo attract more online purchases from China, the merits of online purchases such as lower cost compared to airfreight with only a slightly longer shipping time should be highlighted, and systematic issues such as the expanding simplified clearance for car ferry shipping between Korea and China should be complemented."}]},"fpage":"793","lpage":"811","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.4.793","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.4.002","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002061757","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"12","volume":"31","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002061741","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc120\ubc15\uc885\ub958\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud22c\uc790\ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Diversification Effect of Investments in Ships by Ship Type"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Diversification Effect of Investments in Ships by Ship Type"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc7ac\ubd95(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ubb3c\ub958\ud559\uacfc)","\uc6b0\uc218\ud55c(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc120\ubc15\uc885\ub958\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud22c\uc790 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uadfc 15\ub144\uac04(2000\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2014\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0) \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120, \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc758 \ub2e8\uc77c \uc120\uc885\uc5d0 \ud22c\uc790\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc640 \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc120\uc885\uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud22c\uc790\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc758 \uc120\ubc15 \ud22c\uc790\uc218\uc775\ub960\uacfc \ud22c\uc790\uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120, \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120 \uc678\uc5d0 \ud2b9\uc218\uc120\uacfc\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud22c\uc790 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac80\uc99d\ub3c4 \ub3d9\uc77c\ud558\uac8c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub098\uc544\uac00 \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120, \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120 \ubc0f \ud2b9\uc218\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ud22c\uc790\uc120(Efficient Frontier)\ub3c4 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub974\uba74 \uac1c\ubcc4 \uc120\uc885\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud22c\uc790\uc218\uc775\ub960\uc740 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc6b4 \ubc0f \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc800\uc218\uc775 \uace0\uc704\ud5d8\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \uc778\uc2dd\ud574 \uc628 \ubc14\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc218\uc775\ub960\uc774 \ub192\uc73c\uba74\uc11c \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub450 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc120\uc885\uc774\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ud22c\uc790\ud558\ub294 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120\uacfc \ud2b9\uc218\uc120\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub41c \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\ud22c\uc790 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc88b\uc558\uc73c\ub098 \uadf8 \uc678\uc758 \ud22c\uc790 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \uc870\ud569\ub4e4\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc0b0\ud22c\uc790\ud6a8\uacfc\ub294 \ud06c\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The main purpose of this study is to analyze investment performance for each different type of ships, including major commercial vessels(bulk carrier, tanker and containership) and off-shore vessels(AHTS: Anchor Handling Tug and Supply and PSV: Platform Supply Vessel). This study also attempted to validate the diversification effect of investing in commercial ships and special ships together for the period from 2000 to 2014, using average returns and variances of investments in each type of ships, correlations and covariance of each portfolio.\\nAll investments carry some level of risk and an investment in ships is commonly known as high risk-low return investment, which is quite contradictory to the generally known concept in investment, high-risk and high-return or low-risk and low-return. Considering the super boom before the 2008 global financial crisis, followed by long depression in shipping continuing up to now, the risk profile of an investment in ships is naturally expected to be high. The result of this analysis demonstrated that investments in three major types of commercial vessels showed high returns and high risk profiles. The internal rates of returns of investing in bulk carrier, tanker and containership were 35.5%, 34.7% and 24.9%, respectively. The volatility of the returns, measured in terms of variance and known as investment risk, was 16.3%, 5.8% and 6.9%, respectively. These are relatively high when compared with most businesses. Diversification in various ship types rather than investing in a single type of ship can reduce the volatility or risk, which is well known as the \u201cdiversification effect.\u201d However, as it is evident that the correlations among various types of ship did not show negative or even low relation, not much should be expected from diversification even though some possibilities of diversification can be accomplished. The background behind these high correlation is obvious in that most of ships regardless of types are related to world economic activities in one away or the other. As such, sources of negative or lower correlations among ships are less evident. The lowest correlation is 12.4% for a portfolio with bulk carrier and off-shore vessel whereas the highest of 83.4% for one with tanker and containership. In relation to the diversification effect of portfolio investments in different types of ships, the portfolio consisting of bulk carrier and off-shore vessel turned out to be the most efficient one with the best performance among others while the differences among investment portfolios being minimal.\\nThe areas for further analysis in the future include 1) to check whether there is different pattern in investment return and diversification effect for pre-2008 financial crisis and for post-2008, financial crisis, 2) to measure risk-adjusted performance such as Sharpe ratio and 3) for diversification exercise, to add financial assets such as domestic or foreign stocks and fixed income securities."}]},"fpage":"773","lpage":"791","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.4.773","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.4.005","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002061741","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"12","volume":"31","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002061718","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uade0\ud615\uc131\uacfc\ud45c\uc640 Network-Malmquist \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of the Change in the Efficiency and Productivity of Korean Shipping Companies: Using Balanced Scorecard and Network-Malmquist Model"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of the Change in the Efficiency and Productivity of Korean Shipping Companies: Using Balanced Scorecard and Network-Malmquist Model"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud669\uacbd\uc5f0(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uad6c\uc885\uc21c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Network DEA\uc640 Network-Malmquist \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec BSC\uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

This study aims at analyzing the financial data of Korea\u2019s main shipping companies for the period 2011\u20132014 to establish the change in these companies\u2019 efficiency and productivity using the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) methods, together with the Network-Malmquist model. In this study, 28 shipping companies in Korea were selected as a representative sample because their detailed performance indicators were available from the BSC perspective. The results of Network DEA under the assumption of CRS (constant returns to scale) showed that bulk shipping companies had the highest efficiency, followed by tanker shipping companies and container shipping companies in that order. In terms of company size, companies having less than 100 employees had the highest efficiency, followed by those with 200 employees or more and those with 100 to 200 employees in that order. In the analysis of productivity using the Network-Malmquist model, the productivity of Korea\'s major shipping companies showed a continuing decline since 2012. By shipping type, the productivity of bulk shipping companies showed the smallest decline followed by container shipping companies, while that of tanker shipping companies showed the biggest decline. In terms of company size, shipping companies with 200 employees or more showed the least decline in productivity, followed by those having less than 100 employees, while the shipping companies with 100~200 employees showed the biggest decline. This study has important implications for shipping companies from the perspective of management. First, shipping companies with more than 100 employees should strive to improve their financial performance by enhancing their internal processes and customer service. In the results of Network DEA and traditional DEA, shipping companies having less than 100 employees was found to be more efficient than shipping companies with 100 employees and with 100~200 employees. Therefore, a large-scale shipping company will strive for further efficiencies than small-scale shipping companies to eliminate inefficiencies that appear depending on the larger scale. Second, the major shipping companies in Korea, and in particular, tanker shipping companies, need to make more efforts to improve their productivity. In the analysis of productivity changes using the Network-Malmquist model, productivity of tanker shipping companies showed more decline than in the bulk shipping companies and container shipping companies. Therefore, tanker shipping companies will strive to improve productivity and find ways to overcome the current difficult environment. In addition, shipping companies having less than 200 employees that has reduced the productivity than those with 200 employees or more will require more effort to improve productivity."}]},"fpage":"747","lpage":"772","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.4.747","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.4.004","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002061718","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"12","volume":"31","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002061696","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc548\uc804 \uc131\uacfc \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Determinants of Safety Performance in the Maritime Industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Determinants of Safety Performance in the Maritime Industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc870\ud601\uc218(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc7a5\ud6c8(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 \uac1c\ubcc4\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ubc18\uc774 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub17c\uc758\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \u2018\uc548\uc804(safety)\u2019 \uc774\uc288\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc8fc\uc81c\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc548\uc804\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud55c \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud589 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc548\uc804 \uc131\uacfc\uac00 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc720\ud615 \ud639\uc740 \ubb34\ud615 \uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc131\uacfc\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uad6d\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \uac1c\ubcc4\uad6d\uac00\uc758 \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uc815\ubcf4\ud1b5\uc2e0\uae30\uc220 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc774 \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uad00\ub828 \uc548\uc804 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\ub3c4 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804 \uc131\uacfc\uc640\uc758 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub294 \ucd94\uac00\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uad6d\uac00 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \uc544\ub2cc \uad00\ub828 \uc5c5\uacc4 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790 \ub300\uc0c1 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac(survey)\ub97c \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ud55c\uacc4\uc810\uc744 \ubcf4\uc644\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uc5f0\uad6c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Globalization has played an important role in the maritime industry. A growing competition in marine transportation and seaports has been leaded by the increasing globalization. In particular, globalization of markets or production has led to a rapid increase in vessel movements in many seaports. Many conglomerates are trying to extend enterprises far beyond their home countries via global Supply Chain Management (SCM). It is important for them to compete and survive in the global marketplace. However, on the other hand, the activity to overcome the severe competition may put marine transportation and seaports at risk. The maritime industry has witnessed several accidents worldwide. These disasters have raised the awareness of both researchers and policy makers about the importance of risk assessment and safety in marine transportation and seaport operation. There have been various accidents in marine transportation such as ship collisions, oil spills, ship sinks, etc. In Korea, the sinking of a domestic cruise (the MV Sewol) occurred in 2014. This disaster has raised the awareness of both researchers and policy makers about risk assessment and safety in marine transportation and seaport operation. \'Safety\' has been a key issue in many areas including the maritime industry.\\nAccording to previous studies, there are two different approaches to analyze maritime risk, although there is a considerable overlap (and often confusion) between them. Maritime risk is associated with marine transportation and seaport operation. According to previous studies, safety performance can be an important factor determining competitiveness of the maritime industry. Nevertheless, there are limited studies emphasizing it. Historic safety performance of vessels sailing under particular flags and passenger ferry safety were the core subjects in the previous studies. Some of them assessed the safety of individual vessels or marine structures. Additionally, probabilistic risk assessment in the maritime domain has been discussed. However, there has been little research about risk management in the maritime industry across countries. This study is thus designed to undertake maritime risk and performance in seaport operation with a cross-country empirical analysis.\\nThis study aims to investigate the influence of safety performance to the competitiveness of maritime industry. Various tangible and intangible resources regarding the safety performance and competitiveness are empirically examined with secondary data. This study uses several databases regarding safety performance, infrastructure, ICT capability, efficiency, and network of maritime industry, which contain country-level data. Based on them, this study found that maritime infrastructure and ICT capability can play an important role to improve safety performance of individual countries. This study tested hypotheses with country-level data. We suggest to combine country-level and firm-level data for future research.

Also this study analyzed the effect of job satisfaction factor on job satisfaction by employment type of road freight transport workers(full-time/temporary). By comparing the difference of effect of job satisfaction factors on job satisfaction, we would suggest policies to improve work motivation and promote job satisfaction of road freight transport workers. Data from the 12th to the 15th which has been announced the labor panel in the Korea Labor Institute, 4 years of labor panel data was used. In addition, four years of Labor Panel data was extracted on the road freight transport.\\nAs a result of this study, in the case of full-time workers, the \\"communication and human relationships\\" and \\"welfare system\\" were derived as the most significant factors on job satisfaction which can enhance. On the other hand, \\"job stability\\" and \\"welfare\\" were derived as the most significant factors on job satisfaction which is higher levels for temporary workers.\\nThus, workers in the road freight transport were identified that appear to be the result of differences in job satisfaction factors influenced on job satisfaction by employment type. Unlike most of the previous studies compared differences the job satisfaction between full-time and temporary, this study compared with the impact of differences in the effect of job satisfaction factors on job satisfaction.\\nIn particular, temporary workers of road freight transport prefer that job satisfaction of \\"job stability\\" were more likely than \\"communication and human relationships\\" unlike the full-time workers. And all workers in the road freight transport considered that \\"welfare\\" was the significant factors. Therefore, logistics companies and the government will be established to improve the policies that can be improved by selecting the factors which declined the job satisfaction of temporary workers. Poor working to enhance work motivation and job satisfaction of temporary workers promote environmental and welfare with additional benefits(vacation, bonuses, insurance etc) is believed to have established support policies to increase subscription rates and stable employment.\\nTherefore, in order to improve the job satisfaction of regular and non-regular workers in the logistics industry improvement, rather than a comprehensive approach requires screening for a variety of job satisfaction factors affecting job satisfaction, especially in the case of full-time workers, it should be a priority to increase communication and human relations within the organization, temporary workers in most cases, it should be a priority to increase the employment stability. In addition, it is necessary to relatively poor wages and working conditions was to enhance the support of the welfare system for temporary workers vulnerable to external shocks.\\nThis study, through panel regression analysis by applied Korea Labor Panel data, identified the effect of job satisfaction factors on job satisfaction difference in road freight transport workers of our country logistics industry in the side of the academic significance by employment type. In addition, the results of the this study contributes to critical to the government\'s labor policy in logistics industry in terms of being able to apply a selective support policies for job satisfaction between full-time and temporary workers and the logistics company personnel policy."}]},"fpage":"691","lpage":"708","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.691","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.006","citation-count":"10","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031335","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"09","volume":"31","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002031334","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ud55c\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5 \uac04 \uad00\uacc4\uc640 \uc131\uacfc\ucc28\uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Inter-Corporate Relationships of Korean Exporting Firms and Gaps in Performance in Supply Chains"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Inter-Corporate Relationships of Korean Exporting Firms and Gaps in Performance in Supply Chains"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc30\ud76c\uc131(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc591\uae30(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5 \uac04 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc218\uc900\ub4e4\uc744 \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\uc900\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc218\uc900\ub4e4\uc740 \ub0b4\ubd80\ud611\ub825, \uacf5\uae09\uc790\ud611\ub825, \uace0\uac1d\ud611\ub825 \ubc0f \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc218\uc900\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud45c\ubcf8\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \uacf5\uae09\uc790\ud611\ub825\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \ud45c\ubcf8\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc774 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub9ce\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc218\uc900\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub137\uc9f8, \uacf5\ubd84\uc0b0\ubd84\uc11d\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud611\ub825\uc218\uc900\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \ube44\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubc1b\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc131\uacfc\uc640 \ube44\uc6a9\uc131\uacfc \uac04\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aims of this research are to classify the levels of supply chain collaboration in the relationships between firms and to analyze gaps in performance among the levels. To achieve the aims, this research ascertained the theoretical relationships between the variables and developed conceptual and operational definitions of the variables through prior research. The questionnaire was sent to the members of Korean International Trade Association and 241 data were collected. The results of the analyses are as follows.\\nFirst, the levels of supply chain collaboration are classified into internal collaboration, supplier collaboration, customer collaboration and supply chain collaboration. The result explains that they are mutual independent clusters. The result was analyzed on the basis of clear criteria and as a result, firms can attain internal collaboration, supplier collaboration, customer collaboration and supply chain collaboration in order.\\nSecond, there are the largest numbers of sample firms in supplier collaboration. This reflects the fact that the population is Korean exporting firms. The firms have the low level of involvement with importers because they are exporters rather than the high level of involvement such as foreign direct investment or joint venture. Therefore, they have the high level of collaboration with domestic suppliers rather than oversea importers.\\nThird, there are gaps in cost performance and service performance among the levels of supply chain collaboration and in addition, the result of post hoc analysis explains the amount of performance improvement on the basis of the levels of supply chain collaboration. This reflects the fact that there are gaps in performance among the levels of supply chain collaboration. The result explains that if they want to achieve the high level of performance, they need to find their position in the levels from the viewpoint of strategic choice theory. As a result, they can attain the high level of performance when they move their position on the higher levels of supply chain collaboration on the basis of strategic decision-making. However, the result of post hoc analysis shows that customer collaboration has higher performance than supplier collaboration. The reason is that the sample firms were almost small and medium sized enterprises. In other words, the sample firms are a lack of competence to perform supplier collaboration and customer collaboration simultaneously and as a result, they focus their competence on customer collaboration, followed by high performance. From the viewpoint of the bargaining power of Porter(1980), the bargaining power of customers is higher than the bargaining power of suppliers and as a result, firms which focus on customer collaboration can achieve higher performance.\\nFourth, the result of analysis of covariance shows that gaps in cost performance among the levels of supply chain collaboration are affected by service performance. However, gaps in service performance are affected by the levels of supply chain collaboration. This means that the levels of supply chain collaboration are based on service performance, which is based on cost performance. This explains the dimensions of performance. Service performance is regarded as the precedent variable of cost performance in the dimension. In other words, from the viewpoint of strategic choice theory, when firms perform strategy, they can achieve service performance firstly, followed by cost performance finally. Therefore, when firms decide strategy, they should firstly consider service performance rather than cost performance."}]},"fpage":"663","lpage":"689","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.663","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.004","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031334","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"09","volume":"31","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002031333","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\ub0b4 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ucd9c\ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Ways for Domestic Logistics Enterprises to Enter the New Logistics Market"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Ways for Domestic Logistics Enterprises to Enter the New Logistics Market"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc728\uc131(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc591\uc724\uc625(\ubd80\uc0b0\ubc1c\uc804\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc774 \uc544\uc9c1 \uc9c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc9c0\ub294 \ubabb\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \uc9c4\ucd9c\uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uac70\ub098 \uc2e0\uaddc \uac1c\ucc99\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58\uac00 \ub192\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uad6d\ub0b4 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc774 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc9c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc9c4\ucd9c\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\ub85c\ub294 \uccab\uc9f8, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc790\uc6d0\uc870\ub2ec\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc2e0\uc7ac\uc0dd\uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0\uc640 \ud3d0\uc790\uc6d0\xb7\ub9ac\uc0ac\uc774\ud074 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc804\ub9dd\uacfc \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud574\uc678\uc870\ub2ec\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uad6d\uc81c\uae30\uad6c(UN)\uc870\ub2ec\uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc \uacf5\uc801\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0\uc870(ODA)\uc870\ub2ec\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc911\ub7c9\ud654\ubb3c \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 LO-LO\uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc RO-RO\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc804\ub9dd\uacfc \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub137\uc9f8, \ucf5c\ub4dc\uccb4\uc778 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub18d,\ucd95,\uc218\uc0b0\ubb3c \ubc0f \ud654\ud6fc, \uac00\uacf5\ud488, \uc758\uc57d\ud488 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uad6d\ub0b4 \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ucd9c\ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \ud0c0\ucf13\uc2dc\uc7a5, \ud488\ubaa9\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc120\uc815 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc758 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc9c4\ucd9c\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Along with heightened expectations that there will be a rise in exports of South Korea according to a global economic recovery and growth of concluded FTAs, there is a high possibility that logistics enterprises in South Korea will develop new international markets.

The study examined logistics markets which logistics enterprises of South Korea have not entered or need to newly develop. The study also selected new logistics markets which are expected to be highly value-added in the future and suggested ways within the capacity of the domestic logistics enterprises to enter those markets.\\nFirstly, it was shown that new regeneration energy, waste resources, and recycling logistics markets hold great promise for the future regarding energy and resource procurement markets. Ways to enter those markets suggested logistics enterprises\u2019 efforts to seek ways to enter the global market in connection with resources development, to expand and develop trade with the countries in the Far Eastern area and to develop diversified energy projects.\\nSecondly, it was shown that there were UN procurement market and ODA procurement market regarding foreign procurement markets. Ways to enter those markets suggested expanding information channels through KOICA and training experts for procurement markets.\\nThirdly, it was shown that LO-LO and RO-RO markets hold great promise for the future regarding heavy cargo logistics markets. Ways to enter those markets suggested designating a port operated exclusively for heavy cargo, establishing the network for heavy cargo and project cargo transport and providing support.\\nFourthly, it was shown that agricultural, marine, livestock, and floriculture products and medicine and medical supplies logistics markets hold great promise for the future regarding cold chain logistics markets. Ways to enter those markets suggested creating effective promotion plans by selecting target markets and products step-by-step, promoting cold chain logistics clusters for each product unit, establishing a platform for cargo owners and the logistics enterprises to enter the market together.\\nTo develop new logistics markets, building support systems which include promotion of the plans to be carried out step-by-step, establishment of cooperative systems between the central and local governments and private enterprises, and financial support is required."}]},"fpage":"643","lpage":"661","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.643","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.002","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031333","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"09","volume":"31","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002031332","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc \uc5f0\uacc4\ud55c \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A study on the evaluation of the competitiveness of Ulsan port related to the Northern Logistics Market"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A study on the evaluation of the competitiveness of Ulsan port related to the Northern Logistics Market"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc131\uc6b0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc190\ubcf4\ub77c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc774\ud64d\uc6d0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 IPA \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubc0f \ubd81\uadf9\ud574\ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5 \ub4f1 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc640 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ub0b4\xb7\uc678\uc801 \uc694\uc778, \uc11d\uc720 \ubc0f \ubd81\uadf9\ud574 \ud56d\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc57c, \ucd1d 21\uac1c\uc758 \uc138\ubd80 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uc561\uccb4\ud654\ubb3c \ucc98\ub9ac \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc774 \ubc18\uc601\ub418\uc5b4 \uc561\uccb4\ud654\ubb3c \ucc98\ub9ac \uc2dc\uc124\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uc640 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c \ubc18\uba74 \ubd81\uadf9\ud574 \ud56d\ub85c \uc774\uc6a9 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c, \uadf9\ub3d9\ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \ud654\uc8fc \uc720\uce58 \ub4f1 \uc2e0\uaddc\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ubc0f \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \ucc3d\ucd9c \ubc29\uc548 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uc640 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub294 \ub0ae\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ub300\uc751 \ubc29\uc548 \ub9c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc561\uccb4\ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc6b8\uc0b0\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd81\ubc29\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc5f0\uacc4\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ucd94\ud6c4 \ud658\ub3d9\ud574\uad8c\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc9c4\ud589\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc218\uc900\uacfc \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ud56d\ub9cc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc81c\uace0 \ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Recently, the ports in the Circum-East Sea Bloc have been expected to grow with Eurasian initiative policies and commercial use of the NSR (Northern Sea Route). As a result, this opens a new possibility for Ulsan port to be the oil hub of Northeast Asia. Ulsan port is facing a new environment in the form of the Northern Logistics Market and the emergence of the NSR. To cope with this changing market environment, this study has analyzed the importance and satisfaction of Ulsan port through IPA analysis based on a survey of intended Ulsan port users. The analysis revealed that the \u201cscope of concentration\u201d factors of \u201cport investment accounts\u201d, \u201cport expandability\u201d and \u201clogistics cost\u201d are characterized by low satisfaction and high importance. \u201cInfrastructure level\u201d, \u201cport operation\u201d and \u201cnetwork construction\u201d are grouped under the \u201cscope of keep up the good work\u201d, which are characterized by high satisfaction and importance. Therefore, Ulsan port is believed to manage such factors well. The factors under the \u201cscope of possible overkill\u201d include \u201cscale of adjacent economy\u201d, \u201cpetroleum refinery\u201d and \u201ctank storage facility\u201d, which are characterized by low importance and high satisfaction. This can reflect the fact that characteristics of Ulsan port such as liquid bulk cargo and handling have been considered, and plans to sustain such factors should be prepared in the near future. Finally, the factors considered in the \u201cscope of possible overkill\u201d include \u201cincentive of using NSR\u201d and \u201cattracting far-east Russian shippers\u201d, which are characterized by low importance and satisfaction. These results show that the importance of competition among the ports for the Northeast Asia Oil Hub port, Russian energy resource development, and trends of world energy development and consumption has not become widely accepted. The result of analysis shows that the factors of satisfaction and importance reflect the features of Ulsan port. Therefore high satisfaction and importance were analyzed for the factors of liquid bulk facilities and port operation. On the other hand, there has been a lack of promotion among logistics companies and shippers regarding the possible changes of growth potential of the Arctic Ocean passage. Ulsan port must establish long-term strategies and continuous interest to prepare for the development of the Russian port as well as the trends of world energy development and consumption. This study is a significant attempt to analyze the competitiveness of Ulsan port to handle liquid bulk cargo in the changing Northern Logistics Market.

The super efficiency model is a method for selecting the most efficient of all efficient decision making units (DMUs). The super SBM (slack-based measure of super-efficiency) model was introduced as an alternative method to calculating the super efficiency score without considering the slacks of input variables and output variables. Using these models, the most efficient DMU has a value greater than one. The Malmquist productivity index has many attractive features. For one thing, it decomposes the result into a technical efficiency change index and frontier change index, allowing the productivity change to be attributed to either changes in technical efficiency or changes in technology(i.e., technological progress in the industry), or both. The total factor productivity change is the product of technical efficiency change and technological change. Technical efficiency change can be decomposed into pure technical efficiency and scale efficiency change. Window analysis is one of methods used to verify productivity change over time and works on the principle of moving averages. DEA window analysis is used to measure efficiency in cross-sectional and time variant data. Thus, it is useful for detecting performance trends for a DMU over time. Each DMU is treated as a different industry in a different period, which allows for increasing the number of data points. In other words, each DMU in a different period is treated as if it were an independent DMU but remains comparable in the same window. The advantage of DEA window analysis is that the performance of an industry in a given period can be compared to itself and to other industries over time. The empirical results are as follows: First, by both the super CCR efficiency and super SBM efficiency methods, inefficiency of land transport and water transport was indicated as 67-74% and 30-44% respectively. These results indicate that land is the most inefficient form of transport, whereas water transport is the most efficient. The annual efficiency values revealed that the degree of inefficiency has increased since 2011. Also, detailed results for sectors show that ocean shipping is the most efficient way to transport cargo, whereas urban rail transport is the most inefficient. Second, tobit panel analysis showed that labor productivity has positive impact on efficiency, whereas average cost has negative impact on efficiency. Third, the DEA window analysis results calculated using LDP values and standard deviations show that ferry transport is the most stable, whereas urban railway transport is the most unstable. Fourth, Malmquist productivity index results show that productivity improved 1.6% on average, with technological progress being the major factor decreasing productivity. These results indicate that it is necessary to expand the logistics market to increase the efficiency of the industry. To do so, many efforts must be made to global leadership in logistics enterprises, invest on global logistics infrastructure, increase research and development, and expand the future use of new technologies."}]},"fpage":"587","lpage":"620","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.587","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.003","citation-count":"12","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031362","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"09","volume":"31","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002031330","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"UAE \ud56d\ub9cc\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis and Implications of the UAE(United Arab Emirates) Port Industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis and Implications of the UAE(United Arab Emirates) Port Industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc815\ud0dc\uc6d0(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 GCC\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc640\uc758 \ubb3c\uc801 \uad50\ub958\uc758 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc6b0\uc120\uc801\uc73c\ub85c GCC \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubb3c\ub958\ud5c8\ube0c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac \uc7a1\uc740 UAE \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uac80\ud1a0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c4\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uba87 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud558\uba74 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, 2013\ub144 \uae30\uc900 \ud55c\uad6d\uc218\ucd9c\uc758 60% \uc774\uc0c1\uc774 UAE\ub85c \uc911\uacc4\ubb34\uc5ed \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \ucd94\uc9c4\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud22c\uc790 \ub2c8\uc988\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc81c\uc870+\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc9c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ub300\uc548\uacfc \ud604\uc9c0\uae30\uc5c5\uacfc\uc758 \uc870\uc778\ud2b8 \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc9c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574 \ubcfc \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, UAE\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\ub3d9 \ubc0f \uc544\ud504\ub9ac\uce74 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ucd08\uae30\uc9c0\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc138\uae08\uba74\uc81c, \uc678\uad6d\uc778 \ub178\ub3d9\uc790 \uc790\uc720\ucc44\uc6a9, \uacfc\uc2e4\uc1a1\uae08 \uaddc\uc81c\uac00 \uc5c6\uc73c\uba70 2013\ub144 9\uc6d4 \ud604\uc7ac \ud55c\uad6d\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 80\uac1c\uc0ac\uac00 \uc785\uc8fc\ud574 \uc788\ub294 \uc81c\ubca8\uc54c\ub9ac \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ucde8\uae09\ud560 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud0c0\ucf13 \ud654\ubb3c\ub85c\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \ubd80\ud488, \ucca0\uac15\uad00\ub828 \uc81c\ud488, \ud558\uc774\ud14c\ud06c \uc0b0\uc5c5, \uc2dd\ud488 \ub610\ub294 \uac00\uacf5\uc2dd\ud488 \ub4f1\uc744 \uace0\ub824 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The recent oil-rich economy created by the Gulf Cooperation Council(GCC) is driven by a variety of government policies that promote national economic development plans. The GCC countries have emerged as the central axis for project market, with an average of US$20,000 in national income per head. In GCC Countries 20 million people live within a four-hour drive to the airport. Additionally, GCC member states offer favorable conditions for the logistics industry. with the world\'s largest oil reserves and as a leading exporter of oil, the GCC countries offer relatively cheap access to fuel. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is one of the GCC countries. The UAE has opened large-scale free trade zones surrounded by ports and airports since the 1970s to attract foreign direct investment and has evolved into a logistics hub for the Middle East. The annual trade volume of the Korea and the GCC accounted for 11% of the Korea\' trading partners for global trade and 3.5 percent of Korea\u2019s exports for the world export marking 7th ranking. The annual trade volume of Korea and the GCC accounted for 11% of Korea\u2019s global trade with partners and 3.5% of exports from Korea, the world\u2019s 7th largest exporter. Despite the significance of studies on trade between Korea and the GCC, the policy plan for Korean companies to make inroads in the UAE free trade zone has proven insufficient. This study presents recommendations for Korean domestic logistics companies to successfully penetrate the free trade zones. The study uses the current status and development plans of ports and the port industry in the UAE in their role as the regional logistics hub of the GCC. A summary of the implications of this study is as follows. First, UAE, as a gateway to the Middle East and Africa, has been encouraging transit trade. Korean logistics enterprises should expand and construct joint logistics centers with local businesses. Second, Korean logistics enterprises should exploit the Jebel Ali Zone located in Dubai as a logistics base from which to penetrate the Middle East and African markets, which provide various benefits such as tax exemptions and free hiring of foreign workers for foreign investors. Finally, the main target cargo to be handled by Korean logistics companies are auto parts, steel-related products, high-tech industry products, and processed food.

Since exports are a vital factor in the overall development of a port, some means of quantitatively assessing export changes must be developed. If shifts in exports can be isolated, they can be used to explain partially structural transformations in ports and to provide insight into possible future direction for port development. This study, therefore, uses a shift-share technique to isolate the various factors associated with export changes.\\nThe traditional shift-share model partitions the change of exports in a port into three effects: the national growth effect, the industrial mix effect and the regional share effect. The national growth effect attempts measure the change in exports in a port that would have occurred if its exports had grown at precisely the same rate as the national average. Hence, if a port grows at the same rate as the national average, it does not possess any comparative advantage in terms of resource endowments or human capital. The industrial mix effect associates the differential growth rate in exports between the region in question and the nation as a whole with the overall strengths or weaknesses of the relevant export sectors. Ideally, it is expected that a large proportion of a port\u2019s exports should be concentrated in faster-growing industries. The regional share effect accounts for the differential change between a port and the nation. The regional share effect portrays the competitive position of a port in relation to the rest of the port. For instance, an export component that is growing faster in a port than its counterparts in the nation as a whole will add to the port\u2019s overall growth relative to that of the nation, while a slower-growing component will bring forth an opposite effect.\\nThe export data used in this study are obtained from the Korea International Trade Association and consist of exports by two ports of 20 individual products. The particular product categories studied are at three-digit MTI (Ministry of Trade and Industry) level of disaggregation. The national growth effect for synthetic resin and steel plate-rolled products accounted for about 96 percent and 102 percent respectively of the increase in exports of Gwangyang Port or 3,685 and 4,226 million dollars respectively during the period under analysis. The fact that the industrial mix effects of the two products were negative\u2212at 486 and 1,191 million dollars, respectively\u2212can be interpreted to mean that Gwangyang Port\u2019s main export products were growing slowly rather than rapidly. The regional share effects of the two products did not explain a large proportion of the change\u2212at about 16 percent and 27 percent, respectively. The greatest regional share impact was in the steel plate-rolled product sector. The national growth effect of the automobile industry accounted for about 99 percent of the increase in export of Incheon Port or 3,378 million dollars, while that for the flat panel display only explained 1 percent or 100 million dollars. The regional share effect of flat panel display, however, explained a very large percentage of the change\u221288 percent or 12,238 million dollars\u2212compared with automobiles, at 46 percent or 1,585 million dollars. The industrial mix effect of the two products was negative or explained only a small portion of the change."}]},"fpage":"549","lpage":"567","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.549","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.008","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031328","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"09","volume":"31","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002031326","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc2dc\ud669 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud328\ud134 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of Ship Investment Pattern according to Changing Shipping Market Conditions"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of Ship Investment Pattern according to Changing Shipping Market Conditions"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ud0dc\ud718(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc678\ud56d\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc704\uae30 \uc6d0\uc778\uc774 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uc758 \uc2e4\uae30(\u5931\u671f)\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud568\uc744 \uc8fc\ubaa9\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud328\ud134\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc18c\uc218\uc758 \uadfc\ud574\uc815\uae30\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \ubd80\uc815\uae30\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uace0 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc120\uc0ac\uac00 2011\ub144 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\uac00 \uc815\uc810\uc744 \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ud6c4 \ud558\ub77d\ud558\ub294 \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, 2013\ub144 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \ub300\ud615 \uc815\uae30\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc678\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc120\uc0ac\uac00 \uc804\ub144 \ub300\ube44 \ud558\ud5a5\uc138\ub97c \ubcf4\uc5ec \ubd88\ud669\uae30 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\uace0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c 1) \ubd88\ud669\uae30 \uc870\uae30\uacbd\ubcf4 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ub3c4\uc785, 2) \uacfc\ud559\uc801 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815, 3) \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131 \uac15\ud654, 4) \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30\ubd88\ud669 \uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \uc0ac\uace0 \uc99d\ub300 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Due to shipping recession triggered by the global financial crisis, the Baltic Dry Index (BDI), an economic indicator issued daily for the shipping industry, fell from 10,000 points before and the end of 2007 to 600 points at the end of 2008. At the end of May 2015, the BDI stood at 580 points. The Korea Maritime Institute\u2019s Business Survey Index (BSI) for the shipping industry stands at 66 points, indicating that the economic outlook for the industry is not bright. Investigations have revealed that dry bulk cargo, containers, and tankers is 61 points, 88 points, and 67 points respectively. Compared to the previous month, profitability index, cash flow index, and sales index declined th 82%, 77%, and 74%, respectively. Experts insist that the situation can be assuaged by strengthening financial stability through expanded government support, increasing vessel size, and securing strategic alliances. Despite these claims, government interest in the shipping industry, and hence their policy priorities are low. In addition, the policy focuses on developing the cruise industry.\\nRecently, the global shipping industry has undergone environmental and structural changes, regarding the pressure to minimize air pollution, the severe slowdown in the recovery of market indices, and worsening returns due to commercial vessel\u2019 oversupply. In this era of slow growth and long-term depression, enlarging fleets and companies is the most appropriate strategy for realizing scale economy. Yet, large Korean companies like Korealines, Hanjin Shipping, Hyundai Merchant Marine, and STX Pan Ocean, have experienced a liquidity crisis. According to Stopford(2009), the end of the depression should results in a boom for the industry, but the recent depression has impacted the business considerably.\\nThis study analyzes shipping investment behavior patterns (SIBPs) and suggests several managerial implications to help improve shipping vessel\u2019s liquidity.\\nThe results of the study show that, with the exception of short sea shipping companies and tramp, most lines scored high ship investment pattern. The result for 2013 indicates that all liners, except some mega liners, experienced a declining trend compared to last year, thus, the SIBP is stable.\\nThe results thus provide several managerial implications. There is a need to 1) introduce a preliminary early warning system, 2) undertake scientific decision-making to improve SIBPs, 3) strengthen the flexibility of decision-making, and 4) adopt holistic thinking while considering all the internal factors contributing to the crisis."}]},"fpage":"529","lpage":"547","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.529","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.007","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031326","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"09","volume":"31","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002031325","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ubc15 \ub300\ud615\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc120\ubc15 \uc81c\uc6d0 \uc608\uce21\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Evolution of Container Vessel Sizes and its Impact on the Vessel Specifications"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Evolution of Container Vessel Sizes and its Impact on the Vessel Specifications"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc870\uc131\uc6b0(\uad70\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc6d0\uc2b9\ud658(\uad70\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc8fc\ud638(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ub300\ud615\ud654 \uc694\uc778 \ubc0f \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc558\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \uc120\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \ud5c8\ube0c\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc704\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc790\ub8cc\uc778 2\ub9cc 5000TEU\uae09 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 3\ub9cc TEU\uae09 \ucd08\ub300\ud615 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uc2dc\uae30\uc640 \ud574\ub2f9 \uc120\ubc15\ub4e4\uc758 \uc81c\uc6d0(\uc120\uc7a5, \uc120\ud3ed, \ucd5c\ub300\ud758\uc218)\uc744 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624\ubcc4\ub85c \ub098\ub204\uc5b4 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \ucd9c\ud604\ud55c \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8 \ubcc0\ud654, \uadfc\ub798 10\ub144\uac04\uc758 \ucd94\uc138 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc758 \uc758\uacac\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud574\ubcfc \ub54c \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ub300\ud615\ud654\ub294 \ub2f9\ubd84\uac04 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub9dd\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud0c0 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 3\uc774 \uc815\ud655\ub3c4\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 2\ub9cc TEU\uae09\uc740 2017\ub144, 2\ub9cc 5000TEU\uae09\uc740 2022\ub144 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 3\ub9cc TEU\uae09\uc740 2026\ub144 \uc6b4\ud56d\ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \uc120\ubc15 \uc81c\uc6d0\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub3c4 \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 3\uc774 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub77c\uace0 \ud310\ub2e8\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 2\ub9cc 5000TEU\uae09 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc120\uc7a5 474m, \uc120\ud3ed 61m, \ucd5c\ub300\ud758\uc218 18.3m\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, 3\ub9cc TEU\uae09 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc740 \uc120\uc7a5 517m, \uc120\ud3ed 65m, \ucd5c\ub300\ud758\uc218 19.4m\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In the early 2000\u2019s, many maritime researchers had a negative opinion about this question \u201cIs it possible to go beyond the 18kTEU barrier?\u201d However, 18kTEU+ container vessels have been operated since the second half of 2013.

(1) the capital costs for the larger units are actually not increasing in a linear progression but slightly below that (2) the economies of scale of the voyage costs can be reduced to the single biggest cost driver: the propulsion consumption of the ships (3) it could be explained the increase of ocean route service demand and the extension of international trade (4) the liner service market becomes more competitive due to the gradual collapse of shipping conference. The mega shipping companies try to have the mega container vessels more and more in order to survive the intense competition.\\nThe main maritime routes are expected to redesigned with hub-ports as the center that are being secured depth and infrastructure fixes such as longer and stringer quays, container crane(quay crane). \u201cMega-ships have mega-dimensions, which pose challenges to ports and require adaptations.\u201d Some main ports in republic of Korea should be prepared to maintain the position of hub-ports. Ports, that is oriented hub-ports all over the world, located in Singapore, Netherlands, and China just accelerate the expansion of port facilities and the development of new concept container terminal system This study examines some determinants and trends with the growing container vessel size. The purpose of this study is to propose the time of first appearance on 25kTEU and 30kTEU class container ship and analyze the expected vessel specifications above-mentioned container ships.\\nThe results of this paper are as follows: Firstly, we expect the trend of growing container vessel size to last due to changing in the scale of container ships from the past until now, trend over 10 years, and the opinion of a so-called \u2018experts.\u2019 Secondly, in case of the first service time on ultra large container ships, a scenario 3 of this study is a very high accuracy in comparison with other previous studies. Analysis shows that 20kTEU+ will begin to service in 2017, 25kTEU+ will provide service in 2022, and 30kTEU+ might start to operate in 2026. Thirdly, a scenario 3 of this study is considered appropriate result in the expected vessel specifications. The following are the estimated specifications in case of 25kTEU class (1) Length overall: 474m (2) Breadth: 61m (3) Scantling draft: 18.3m and in case of 30kTEU class, (1) Length overall: 517m (2) Breadth: 65m (3) Scantling draft: 19.4m."}]},"fpage":"507","lpage":"528","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.3.507","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.3.005","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002031325","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003254","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc785\ucc30\uc81c \ud65c\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uace0\ucc30: \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc8fc\uc694\ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \uc804\uc790\uc785\ucc30\uc81c \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Electronic Bidding System for bulk Market in Korea: In the Cases of Electronic bidding system of the Korean major shippers"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Electronic Bidding System for bulk Market in Korea: In the Cases of Electronic bidding system of the Korean major shippers"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc900\ud638(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ubc15\uc0ac\uacfc\uc815)","\uc724\uc601\uae38(\ubc30\ud654\uc5ec\uc790\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"21\uc138\uae30 \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc804\uc790\ubb34\uc5ed\uc758 \ucd9c\ud604\uacfc \ud568\uaed8 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \ubb34\ud55c\uacbd\uc7c1 \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc313\uae30\uc5d0 \uacbd\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4 \uc5ed\uc2dc \uc804 \uc138\uacc4 \uacf3\uacf3\uc758 \uace0\uac1d\ub4e4\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uad81\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ube44\uc6a9\uc808\uac10\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc7a5\ud615\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ub3c4\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uace0\uc720\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc0c1 \uc804\uc790\ubb34\uc5ed\uc774 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc8fc\uccb4\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \uc815\ubcf4\uad50\ud658 \ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ubcf4\uc870\uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \ub354 \ucef8\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74, \uc644\uc804\uacbd\uc7c1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub418\uba74\uc11c \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\uac04\uc5d0 \uc6b4\uc784\ud615\uc131\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc758 \ud65c\uc6a9\ub3c4\uac00 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub192\ub2e4\uace0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc804\uc790\uc785\ucc30\uc81c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d\uc744 \uccb4\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc774 \ub110\ub9ac \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc778 \uc804\uc790\uc785\ucc30\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud654\uc8fc\ub4e4\uc774 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d \uc2dc \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc804\uc790\uc785\ucc30\uc81c\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc0ac\ub840\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac70\ub798\ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc870\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc785\ucc30\uc81c\ub3c4\uc640 \uc815\ubcf4 \ubcf4\uc548\ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uad6c\ucd95\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Getting into 21st century\'s, all of global companies have been trying to increase its competitive in unlimited competition for the purpose of survival. Futhermore, internet-technology led appearance of electronic trade in accordance with the rapid change of management surroundings.\\nMost shipping companies also try to meet customer\'s need and set up various e-market places within the shipping industry along with a such change, ultimately aim to make cost-effective. however, the electronic trade is limited to role as a secondary tool for exchange of information rather than actual trading process because of the industry\'s characteristic. In a case of bulk market which plays a part in perfect competitive market, basically could form ocean-freight among the participants such as shippers and shipowners, its applicability for electronic trade is relatively higher than other sectors, especially, it works for contract of carriage.\\nIn this paper, we analyze electronic bidding system for bulk market in Korea and investigate electronic bidding system which is practically and widely operated by major shippers in Korea when the shippers sign contracts of carriage to import primary raw materials such as coal or iron ore from foreign countries. In this regard, the study contributes to the literature in several ways, comparing to a number of previous studies were mainly focused on e-market place for the shipping industry. As a result of case studies, we point out some findings leading to few problems when majors shippers in Korea - Posco/Kepco/Hyundai Steel - make contract with shipping companies through electronic bidding system. First, shippers used to run the lowest bid price method considering only pricing element as a standard of contracts, which could occur dumping in bid and collusion as well as a short of safety in transportation. Secondly, there were transparency in bidding process and a risk of information leakage due to a lack of well-managed system. Thirdly, we observe drain of national wealth, which is resulting from not operational issues of electronic bidding system but contractual usage in shipping market. However, the open-competition electronic bidding by major shippers has underlying implication for the problem than other contract methods. For example, every registered bidder in each system could take unlimitedly participate in the bidding, regardless of importance and scale of contracts.\\nThe main aim of the paper is to ensure fair and stable transaction environment in Korean bulk market through efficient implementation of electronic bidding system. On the other hands, it is important to acknowledge limitations of the study, which we have observed the problem in shipping company\'s prospects and investigated samples for Korean major shippers only.\\nTherefore, we would like to suggest to do ongoing research against the subject by doing comparative studies and empirical tests in future so as to find out advanced solution."}]},"fpage":"467","lpage":"488","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.467","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.004","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003254","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003237","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"VAR \ubaa8\ud615\uacfc Bayesian VAR \ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21\ub825 \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Study of Forecasting Trade Volume Between Bayesian and General VAR Models"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Study of Forecasting Trade Volume Between Bayesian and General VAR Models"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ud604\uc11d(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc7a5\uba85\ud76c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2000\ub144 1\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130 2012\ub144 4\uc6d4\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc6d4\ubcc4 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud658\uc728\uacfc \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc77c\ubc18\uc801\uc778 VAR \ubaa8\ud615\uacfc Bayesian VAR \ubaa8\ud615\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc608\uce21\ub825 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ube44\ubaa8\uc218 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \uc790\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc548\uc815\uc131 \uac80\uc815 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc774 1\ucc28 \ucc28\ubd84\uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.

There exist a variety of investigation to find a unique relationship between trade volume and economic indicators on the basis of economic theory or properties of the dataset.\\nIn the contents of many approaches to the trade volume, interest focused on finding effective factors through the various evaluation methods such as long-run relationship or factor analysis. However, among these are the testing procedure, the presence of regression based causality and cointegration only. Alternatively, we propose multivariate approaches, general VAR and Bayesian VAR, to forecast trade volume including macroeconomic determinants such as foreign exchange rate and Baltic Dry-bulk Index(hereafter BDI) and show forecasting power between the frameworks. Specifically we perform in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts using general VAR and Bayesian VAR in this investigation.\\nAs a first step, we test stationarity of the series using parametric and nonparametric methods. All the series span the period January 2000 to April 2012 and show nonstationary of ADF(augmented Dickey-Fuller), KPSS(Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin) and LM(Leybourne and McCabe) tests in the level. When the series are first-differenced, the results shows stationary. These are also called unit root processes in the level, and processes integrated of order 1. We then perform the Johansen cointegration test among the variables but it shows insignificant, which is consistent with previous results that include global financial crisis periods in 2008.\\nMacroeconomic practitioners frequently work with multivariate nonstationary time series. However, the majority face how to consider the stationarity issues as well as model specifications. Regarding the stationarity, Bayesian methods have become increasingly popular as a way of overcoming stationarity problem of the series. That is, Bayesian VAR can circumvent the information loss because the approach is able to estimate the model without the restrictions.\\nWe perform in-sample and out-of-sample forecasts to compare the power between general and Bayesian approaches. For comparing the performance between general and Bayesina VAR forecasts we first estimate mean-based error to the variables and then estimate such as MAFE (Mean Absolute Forecast Error), RMSFE (Root Mean Squared Forecast Error), and RMSPFE (Root Mean Squared Percentage Forecast Error) to evaluate the forecasting power of the models. Forecasting power is measured using the ration of Bayesian VAR against general approach and, while there is a little similarity with in-sample forecasts, its economic value is significantly different. In particular, the overall estimated results from error-based analysis to the out-of sample forecast imply that Bayesian VAR is superior to the general VAR forecasts in trade volume."}]},"fpage":"449","lpage":"466","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.449","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.001","citation-count":"11","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003237","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003221","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ubc15\ub300\ud615\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uc218\uc694 \uc608\uce21\uacfc \uacf5\uae09 \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc18c\uace0"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Demand Forecast for Maritime Pilots considering the Enlargement of Ship Size and Improvements on the Pilot Supply Policy"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Demand Forecast for Maritime Pilots considering the Enlargement of Ship Size and Improvements on the Pilot Supply Policy"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ud0dc\uc77c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uae40\uba85\uc11d(\ud55c\uad6d\ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac\ud611\ud68c)","\uc774\ub098\uc601(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\ubc15\uc6a9\uc548(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc5d0 \uae30\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ub300\ud615\ud654 \uc18d\ub3c4\uac00 \ube68\ub77c\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0 \ucc29\uc548\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ubc15\ub300\ud615\ud654\uac00 \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ub2e4\ub8e8\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uacf5\uae09\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uac1c\uc120 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uc218\uae09 \uc815\ucc45 \uc218\ub9bd\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac01\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc218\uc694 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud55c \ud6c4 \uc120\ubc15\ub300\ud615\ud654 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uc218\uc694\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uc218\uc694\uac00 \uacfc\uac70\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud06c\uac8c \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub9dd\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub9cc \uacf5\uae09 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\uc120\uc218\uc2b5\uc0dd \uc804\ud615\uc2dc\ud5d8 \uc751\uc2dc\uc790\uc758 \uace0\ub839\ud654 \ucd94\uc138\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \ub77c\uc774\ud504 \uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc758 \ucd95\uc18c\uac00 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc774\ub294 \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac \uacf5\uae09 \ubc0f \uc790\uc9c8 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ucd08\ub798\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub3c4\uc120\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc218\uc694 \ub454\ud654 \uc804\ub9dd\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uacf5\uae09\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ub0b4\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ub3c4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uacf5\uae09\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc2b9\uc120\uc694\uac74\uc758 \uc644\ud654, \uc591\uc131 \uccb4\uacc4\uc758 \uac1c\uc120, \uc2dc\ud5d8\uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \uac1c\ud3b8 \ubc0f \uc790\uc9c8 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ubc29\uc548 \ub4f1\uc744 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub3c4\uc120 \uc815\ucc45 \ub2f9\uad6d \ubc0f \ub3c4\uc120\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc720\uc775\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The pilotage market is undergoing many environmental changes of which the enlargement of ship size is a typical example. Whereas the vessels of 75,000 tons or more out of the total vessels calling at South Korean ports have shown a double-digit growth, the number of ships below the size of 75,000 tons has recorded a mere one-digit or negative growth from 2001 to 2013. Such growth in large-sized vessels is expected to affect the demand of maritime pilots as it will decelerate the number of ships calling at ports.\\nIn this study, we first forecasted the demand of pilots in consideration of the trend of increase in the size of the vessels calling at Korean ports. In the latter part of the study, we derived alternative suggestions for improving pilot supply policy. As shown in the results of the analysis, the average annual growth rate of the pilotage acts for ships recorded 6.8% in 1992-2002 but it is expected to shrink to 1.4% in 2015-2025.\\nEventually, the number of pilotage acts performed by one pilot in 2025 is expected to be 613 based on the simple regression analysis. However, considering the size effect, that figure is expected to decrease to 585 and the total number of 7,337 ships under pilotage in the overall pilotage market will be reduced. Consequently, the number of pilots is forecasted to reduce about 12 people (11.97 people) in the market.\\nIn the pilot supply side, the number of captains aboard merchant ships of 6,000 tons or more has increased and the average competition rate in the apprentice pilot aptitude test has maintained 10 to 1. Unless the sudden reduction of crew resources is carried out, the pilot supply market is expected to maintain stability until 2025. Nevertheless, it is judged that the life cycle of pilots be shorter than before because the candidates for apprentice pilot aptitude test have been aging. When forecasting the age structure of the candidates for apprentice pilot aptitude test, 55-59 year-old age is expected to exceed 50% in 2017. The trend of aging candidates would play as a biggest problem in the pilot supply structure by shortening the working duration as a pilot, which will lead to supply shortage and quality degradation in the pilotage market.\\nAlthough the demand for pilots is not to be increased significantly, the pilots\' quality and supply problems in the market are expected to take place. To improve pilot supply policies, it is necessary to promote the reforms such as relaxation of pilot boarding requirements, improvement of pilot training and examination systems. With measures to improve the quality of the pilots, these reforms are also going to soften the supply of pilots."}]},"fpage":"427","lpage":"448","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.427","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.009","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003221","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003202","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud658\uc728\ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc678\ud56d\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study of the Impact of Exchange Rate Fluctuation on Profitability of Korean Ocean-Going Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study of the Impact of Exchange Rate Fluctuation on Profitability of Korean Ocean-Going Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc591\ud601\uc900(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ubc15\uc0ac\uacfc\uc815)","\uc774\uae30\ud658(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uba85\ud76c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2002~2013\ub144 \uae30\uac04 \uc911 \ucd1d 55\uac1c \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc678\ud56d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub9e4\ucd9c\uc561\uc601\uc5c5\uc774\uc775\ub960\uc5d0 \ud658\uc728\ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc804\uccb4\uae30\uac04, \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\uc804\uae30\uac04(2002~2007), \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uae30\uac04(2008~2013)\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub610\ud55c \uc804\uccb4 \uc81c\uc870\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ub300\ub2e4\uc218\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ub9c8\ucc2c\uac00\uc9c0\ub85c \ud658\uc728\uc0c1\uc2b9\uc774 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc131\uc5d0 \uc815\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1d\ud600\uc84c\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\uc804 \uae30\uac04\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\ub294 \ud658\uc728\ubcc0\ub3d9\ub960 \ucd94\uc815\uce58\uac00 \uc720\uc758\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\ub098 \uc804\uccb4\uae30\uac04\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uae30\uac04\uacfc\ub294 \uc0c1\ubc18\ub418\uac8c \ud658\uc728\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc218\uc775\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud574\ub2f9 \uae30\uac04\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ucd5c\uace0 \ud638\ud669\uae30\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc601\uc5c5\uc774\uc775\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc6d0/\ub2ec\ub7ec \ud658\uc728\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud558\ub77d\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study investigates the impact of exchange rates fluctuation on Korean ocean-going shipping firm\'s performance during the period of 2002~2013 through comparing pre-global financial crisis period(2002~2007) with post-global financial crisis period(2008~2013) using 55 firms. In order to examine the change of the operating income to sales of Korean ocean-going shipping companies according to exchange rates fluctuation, non-operating profit and loss were excluded in this study.\\nCompany\'s operating margin measured by the operating income to sales is used as a dependent variable and the exchange rate fluctuation is employed as a major independent variable. Utilizing panel data on Korean ocean-going shipping companies, the impact of exchange rates fluctuation on the profit of shipping companies will be empirically examined.\\nThe important results of this empirical analysis are as follows.\\nFirst, this study reveals that the operation performances of Korean ocean-going shipping companies was improved according to the appreciation of Korean Won/US dollar exchange rates between 2002 and 2013 and during the post-global financial crisis period(2008~2013). These results were in line with the findings of several other studies regarding the manufacturing enterprises.\\nSecond, it is found that the findings during the pre-global financial crisis period(2002~2007) are different from the results of the whole period and post-global financial crisis period. That is, during the super-cycle period(2003~the first half of 2008), despite of the fall of Korean Won/US dollar exchange rates, operating margin of Korean ocean-going shipping companies was increased continuously. This different result could be explained by super-cycle in shipping industry to have shown the peak in the shipping business.\\nThird, comparing to the period of post-global financial crisis, the whole period shows that significance level is lower and regression coefficient estimate of Won/US dollar exchange rate variable become smaller. This means that the impact of the exchange rate change on operating margin of Korean ocean-going shipping companies during the post-global financial crisis is greater than the whole period. This result could be explained because of the rapid increasing of the exchange rate since the second-half of 2008. That is, the exchange rate of Korean Won to US dollar was fallen continuously, however, since the global crisis of 2008, the greater changes of exchange rate would have an impact on the operating margin of Korean ocean-going shipping companies.\\nLastly, the coefficient of seaborne trade(SBT) which is one of the explanatory variables is found to be significant. This could be interpreted as a result that the company\'s profitability is improved by the increasing in SBT. Additionally, both tonnage(TON) and total debt/total asset(DEBT) are also significant with showing negative signs. This could be explained by the increasing in the SBT and DEBT to have made the profitability of the company decrease. However, during the pre-global financial crisis period, the coefficient of TON showed a positive sign. This might be explained that in spite of the increasing of the tonnage, the operating profit of the shipping companies has been increased consistently in this period."}]},"fpage":"407","lpage":"425","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.407","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.012","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003202","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003180","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"TOPSIS\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc8fc\uc694 \uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00: \uc218\uc785, \uc131\uc7a5, \uc218\uc775 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ube44\uad50\uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Efficiency Performance of Asia\u2019s Major Airports with TOPSIS- Revenue, Growth, and Profit Approach -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Efficiency Performance of Asia\u2019s Major Airports with TOPSIS- Revenue, Growth, and Profit Approach -"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud558\ubd09\ucc2c(\ubd80\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubb38\uc0c1\uc601(\ud55c\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uacf5\uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9, \ud3b8\uc758\uc2dc\uc124, \uc785\uc9c0, \ud65c\uc8fc\ub85c \uc218, \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uba74\uc801 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uacfc \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \uc5ec\uac1d\uc758 \ud658\uc2b9\uacfc \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \ud658\uc801\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc54c\ub824\uc838 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\ub294 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc788\ub294 \uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d\ub4e4\uc774 \uc9d1\uc911\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc704\uce58\ud574 \uc788\uc5b4 \uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d\ub4e4\uc740 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub9ce\uc740 \uc5ec\uac1d, \ud654\ubb3c, \uc6b4\ud56d\ud3b8\uc218\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uace0\uc790 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc774 \uce58\uc5f4\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d, \uc911\uad6d, \uc77c\ubcf8, \uc2f1\uac00\ud3f4, \ud64d\ucf69 \ub4f1 5\uac1c\uc758 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\uc81c\uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \uc5f0\ucc28\ubcf4\uace0\uc11c\uc5d0 \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c \uc218\uc785, \uc131\uc7a5, \uc218\uc775 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\ud56d \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uc9c0\ub97c \ubc1d\ud600\ub0b4\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uae30\uc900 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\ubc95\uc911 \ud558\ub098\uc778 TOPSIS\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601 \ubc0f \uc7ac\ubb34 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \uc218\uc785, \uc131\uc7a5, \uc218\uc775 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcc0\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uacf5\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc774 \ub2e4\ub974\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294, \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uacf5\ud56d \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\ub4e4\uc774 \uc5b4\ub290 \ubd80\ubd84\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uc120\ud0dd\uc744 \ud574\uc57c\ud558\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"It is assumed that a more efficient airport can handle more passengers and cargo with same infrastructure. In addition, efficiency of the airports is one of the major factors which transfer passengers and transshipment cargo consider a stopover airport as well as costs, convenient facilities, location, and other environmental factors of the airport. Most airport authorities believe that more infrastructure in the airport may positively relate to higher efficiency of airports as well as competitiveness. This is the main reason why airports try to expand length and numbers of runway, numbers of gateway and terminal, and moorings although the airport industry is heterogeneous with quality differentiation and external constraints (Oum et al., 2003).\\nThe objective of this study is to analyze operational and financial performance of airports in Asia. Since there is no consistent and systematic airport industry practice for measuring and comparing airport efficiency performance, this study may provide a meaningful information to airport authorities by comparison of various airport efficiency performances. Especially, this study focuses on non-aeronautical operating revenue which is a crucial factor for the profitability and sustainable growth of contemporary airports all around the world. Non-aeronautical revenue is all other incomes not directly derived from airport fees or air navigation taxes. The revenue includes revenues from offices, retail, advertizement, medical facilities, hotels, and even parking. At present, the non-aeronautical revenue covers the losses that most of them incur on their airside operation.\\nIn order to compare the performance of the Asian major airports we have used the recent four year (2010-2013) Annual Reports of Incheon, Narita, Beijing, Singapore, and Hong Kong International Airports which contain operational results and financial statements as well as other important information on their business environment. Because, as we have explained in the introduction, performance of an airport is hard to measure with a unique criterion, we have used a composite indicator which represents the collective evaluation based on multi-criteria: Technique of Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). In this method performance of airports are compared by the distance from two artificial alternatives: positive and negative ideal alternatives. The closer to the positive ideal alternative and the farther from negative one, the better the performance is.\\nThe measured efficiency numbers of airports show that efficient level of the airport comparing to others. However, the numbers are affected by various factors, some of which are not controlled by airport authority. The variables may not affect the real efficiency of the airports. It means that various aspects of airports should be considered when efficiency of airports is analyzed. Therefore, airport authorities realize what are their competitive advantages and try to enhance the comparative advantage to compete to other airports rather than benchmarks efficiency performance of other airports."}]},"fpage":"391","lpage":"405","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.391","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.008","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003180","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003140","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc785\uc9c0\uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Location Determinants of International Logistics Center"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Location Determinants of International Logistics Center"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uac15\ub2ec\uc6d0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc728\uc131(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc785\uc9c0\uacb0\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc81c\uace0 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uc774\ub860\uc801 \uace0\ucc30\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\uc9c0 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc18c\ub97c 1\ucc28\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec 5\uac1c\uc758 \uc694\uc778\uacfc 17\uac1c \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc18c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c AHP\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc785\uc9c0\uacb0\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0b0\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubb3c\ub958\uc694\uc778\uc774 32.1%, \ube44\uc6a9\uc694\uc778 23.6%, \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc694\uc778 22.4%, \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc694\uc778 13.4%, \ud658\uacbd\uc694\uc778 8.5% \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4\ud56d\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub294 \uc9c0\ub9ac\uc801 \uc704\uce58 \ubc0f \uacf5\ud56d\xb7\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131(12.2%)\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \uc811\uadfc\uc131(11.9%)\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ubcf5\ud569\ubb3c\ub958\uccb4\uacc4(Sea&Air, Sea&Rail \ub4f1)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uacc4\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uacfc \uc804\uccb4 \ubb3c\ub958\ube44\uc6a9\uc758 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8f0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc601\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\ud654\uc640 \uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc870\ud574\uc904 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc785\uc9c0\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd9c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"As globalization and blocking of economy are progressed, firms\' management strategy changes puts more emphasis on the high value added international logistics system which gives weight to its speed and value added service. Global product network is expanded by both the internationalization and the diversification of multimodal transportation system, thereby low cost product cluster is being formed at sea- and airport areas in low cost and high efficiency countries. To build low cost network and manufacture nodes, global supply chain management should be established, therefore, it has a trend that logistics nodes, R&D nodes and manufacture nodes are being formed around major sea port or airport.\\nNormally, determining location of logistics center within international logistics network is recognized to be difficult to have many factors to consider as well as to matter with regards to upper managerial strategy. When it comes to location of logistics center, decision making is hard on account of variety of variants for decision influencing on industrial economic and social cultural aspect. The most common variable amongst determining variants is total cost optimization. So, many previous researches or studies suggested module development was performed for consistency and efficiency of calculation and solution development focused on associated cost minimization.\\nParticularly, competition in securing logistics center of global firms is accelerated as economy and scale of trade are expanded at Northeast Asia and efficient logistics network establishment is distinguished to be the core of administration. Global manufacturing and procurement network expansion are mainly based in Northeast Asia, which are South Korea, China, and Japan. Three countries are geographically close and have large demand market and determination for logistics center location is the main variant for determining supply chain.\\nThe position and the function of logistics center are building up when it comes to increasing or decreasing added value as a core. The role and the function especially emphasizes on the weight of added value. In particular, it is rare to perform systematical studies on concrete location of logistics center although international logistics centers play a great deal of role on northeast Asia.\\nThis study attempts to suggest location determinants of International logistics center. First, it analyzes the factors determining location of International logistics center.

Furthermore, China became the 2nd largest economic scale and now it is playing an important and influential role in the global economy as the world\u2019s factory and market.\\nChina stands out in all areas of industry based on the G2 economic strength, and Internet commerce is also booming. According to data from the China Internet Network Information Center(CNNIC) at June 2014, internet users in China 632 million people, and it seems a 1.1% increase over the previous year to 46.9%, in addition, the population that uses the mobile internet seems to increase 2.4% year of year to 500 million 2,700 million, and total internet users of mobile internet continues to rise to 83.4%(CNNIC, 2014). Because China has showed the rapid growth of the off-line market and on-line market, it is required to research and analysis of logistics services that impact on purchase and repurchase, when people are trading in internet shopping mall.\\nTherefore, the aim of this study is to survey the current statues and utilizes of internet shopping mall and analyze the logistics service qualities of Harbin city in Heilongjiang province, also it is not a study of the entire Chinese but it is focused on local research. Based on this, four elements of the logistics service quality(Delivery quality, Order quality, Customer service, Delivery price) is investigated how it does the effect on customer satisfactions, relationship qualities, and repurchase intentions. To research the logistics service quality of Harbin and verify the hypothesis, research model and hypotheses of this study have been developed it which is based on literature review, and a questionnaire survey was carried out to users who is living in Harbin Area. Seven hypotheses were developed and experimental data were collected and analyzed using SPSSWIN 20 version and AMOS 18 version.\\nThe reliability and validity tests show satisfactory results. These results indicate that delivery quality, order quality, and customer service doesn\u2019t have significant influence to customer satisfaction, but delivery price have significant influence. Customer satisfaction have significant influence to relationship quality and relationship quality have significant influence to repurchase intention, but customer satisfaction doesn\u2019t have significant influence to repurchase intention.\\nIt is very important to continuous support and improvement of logistics service quality of internet shopping in Harbin Area, and also it is needed to consider the characteristics of internet user\u2019s purchasing patten, trading items, modifying payment systems, and foreign goods purchasing consumers\u2019 requirements."}]},"fpage":"353","lpage":"372","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.353","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.007","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003127","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003116","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"DEA\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ud3ec\uc6cc\ub529 \uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of Efficiency of Forwarding Companies using DEA"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of Efficiency of Forwarding Companies using DEA"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ucd5c\uae30\uc6b4(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc724\uc815\ud638(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc774\uc9c4\uaddc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucd5c\uadfc \ud3ec\uc6cc\ub529\uc5c5\uccb4\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uc694\uac10\uc18c, \uc678\uad6d\uacc4 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc120\uc804 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 DEA\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc0c1\uc704 15\uac1c \ud3ec\uc6cc\ub529 \uc5c5\uccb4\ub4e4\uc758 2009~2014\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 5\ub144\uac04 \uacbd\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b4\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \uc99d\ub300\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810 \uc81c\uacf5\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud22c\uc785\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \uc885\uc5c5\uc6d0\uc218, \uc790\ubcf8\uae08, \uc601\uc5c5\uc678\ube44\uc6a9, \uc0b0\ucd9c\ubcc0\uc218\ub85c \ub9e4\ucd9c\uc561, \uc601\uc5c5\uc774\uc775\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uc0bc\uc131\uc804\uc790\ub85c\uc9c0\ud14d, \ud611\uc9c4\ud574\uc6b4, \ud6a8\uc131\ud2b8\ub79c\uc2a4, 3\uac1c \uc5c5\uccb4\uac00 CCR, BCC, \uaddc\ubaa8 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubaa8\ub450 1\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.

These companies were assessed in terms of CCR, BCC, and scale efficiency, and were found to be operating under an appropriately efficient scale. This study aims to determine the operating conditions by analyzing the effectiveness of existing domestic forwarding companies, which has not been studied before, and provide suggestions for improving the operational efficiency of forwarding companies in Korea.\\nThe average efficiency in terms of CCR for the year 2014 was found to be 0.75, which is a low level that indicates over-commitment and inefficiency. The operating expenses and employee capital generation in operational terms exhibited inefficiencies attributable to scale, which had a value of 0.86. The analysis showed that the top three manufacturers need to reduce RTS size in accordance with DRS, which is a sub-group of six companies. Moreover, the operational efficiency of all forwarding companies should be improved and expanded to achieve the appropriate scale according to the IRS.\\nIn addition, the SBM-DEA model was applied to the top 15 forwarding companies to measure the inefficiency of inputs in 2014, based on capital, overall number of employees, and operating expense, which require reductions of 30%, 36%, and 19%, respectively. Such reductions are apparently capable of improving the current inefficiency. Forwarding companies operating in the employee\u2019s ability to significantly influence operating revenue inefficiency requires effective management of human resources identified areas, and in terms of non-operating expenses were also able to verify the effective accounts receivable management and foreign currency transactions management is required.\\nAs this study considered the sales of only the top 15 companies, the operational efficiency of small and medium-sized forwarding companies was not analyzed. Moreover, the network of partnerships and the agency contracts on which the sales are based were not considered.\\nIn the future, variables such as employee careers, cargo throughput, number of network transactions, and number of large customers, which reflect the characteristics of forwarding companies, should be examined. Additional research should also be conducted to account for the factors influencing the establishment of long-term contracts.

The construction began in 2009 and was completed in 2011. The waterway commenced operations in 2012. K-water, which is the Korea water resources corporation in Korea, carried out the project. There are three important functions such as flood prevention, freight transport and a recreational waterfront. The waterway was constructed with a length of 18km, a mean width of 80m and the water depth of 6.3m. There are two ports. Both are located at the end of the waterway. One side is the West Sea and the other side is the Seoul (the capital of South Korea). Each port is composed of a wharf and a port logistics complex. Despite Korean government\'s effort to shift the transport mode from road to coastal shipping including modal shift subsidy scheme, its effect has not been demonstrated yet.\\nThis study aims to present the development strategy of Gyeongin Port with reducing of logistics costs and carbon emissions taken as the basic direction by the support to vitalize short sea shipping, by understanding the present of logistics system between Jeju Island and the mainland, which has been aggravated since the marine accident of the car ferry that carried passengers between Incheon and Jeju in April 2014.\\nThis study analyzed the present status and issues of import-export cargo throughput and the priority for the support system designed to reduce logistics cost between Jeju Island and the mainland, and conducted in-depth analysis using the DEA CK model the focusing manufacturers, wholesalers, retailers and logistics firms (including shipping company) in Jeju island.\\nAs a result of this study, we have revealed that significant differences in awareness of the order of priority in support system to cut logistics costs between Jeju Island and the mainland, or to vitalize coastal shipping were found in extended support to modernize ships and to supply tax-free oil for coastal shipping company. While manufacturing and retail/wholesale companies in Jeju-do island were ranked 1st (5th in supplying tax-free oil to inbound cargo ship) in the category of expanded support for vessel modernization program, logistics companies such as vessel carrier and transportation companies, due to restriction on the support program, received low benefits in real, thus being ranked 6th, the lowest rank (1st in supplying tax-free oil to inbound cargo ship).\\nIn conclusion, in order to enhance distribution system in Jeju-do Island, it is necessary to aggressively expand programs to stimulate coastal shipping. Also, problems in distribution system from Jejudo-island and Seoul metropolitan area should be solved using growth strategy linked to Gyeongin port.\\nThe main limitations of this study include that countermeasure in substantial industry that utilized these findings could be weakened. Because, government policies such as financial support or tax-free for coastal shipping company have been reduced recently by welfare funding, but the application of the government support for activating the coastal shipping and improvement logistics system in Island are needed aggressive efforts by government."}]},"fpage":"309","lpage":"330","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.309","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.003","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003107","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003095","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uacf5\ub3d9\ud654\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uacfc \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Performance and Factors of Determination of Logistic Partnership of Physical Distribution Cooperation"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Performance and Factors of Determination of Logistic Partnership of Physical Distribution Cooperation"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc81c\ud604(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc6a9\uc6b4(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud559\uacfc)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uacf5\ub3d9\ud654\uc5d0 \ucc38\uc5ec\ud55c \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4 \uac04\uc5d0 \ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud615\uc131\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ubb34\uc5c7\uc778\uc9c0 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uace0 \ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825 \ud615\uc131\uc774 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\uac00\uc124\uc744 \ud655\uc778\uc801 \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825\uc744 \ud615\uc131\ud558\ub294 \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc740 \uc720\uc758\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud615\uc131\uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825\uc744 \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uae30\uc5c5\ud2b9\uc131 \uc694\uc778\uacfc \uc758\uc0ac\uc18c\ud1b5 \uc694\uc778, \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\ud2b9\uc131 \uc694\uc778\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80 \ud639\uc740 \uc804\ubd80\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\ub098, \uc6b4\uc601\ud2b9\uc131 \uc694\uc778\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4.\\n\ubb3c\ub958\ud611\ub825 \ud615\uc131\uc694\uc778, \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778 \ubc0f \uc131\uacfc\uac04\uc758 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \ud615\uc131\uc694\uc778\uc740 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \ub192\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc9c0\ub9cc \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc740 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubaa8\ub450 \uae0d\uc815\uc801 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Increasing logistics costs affects profits of firms engaged in manufacturing, distribution, logistics. In this regard, the Governments have carried out, as a method of cost savings, various supporting policies in order to activate logistics public facilities. This, however, comes out not successful due mainly to conflict of participating firms in different business lines, resulting in obstacles of operations.\\nThe success of public logistics facilities depends on cooperation among the participating firms. The logistic partnership of physical distribution cooperation is critical to efficient and effective logistical operations. In order to improve logistic performance, it may be necessary for forms participated in logistic partnership of physical distribution cooperation to form closer cooperation Unfortunately, there are few studies examining the nuance and outcomes of the logistic partnership of physical distribution cooperation And therefore this study identifies elements which form logistics cooperation and analyse whether these elements contribute to performance of logistics and lastly suggests alternatives as to the participating firms\' moving toward trust and devotion together with the government support in different respect.\\nThis study drew, through precedent studies and relevant theories about logistics cooperation, several elements relating to logistics cooperation and operational characteristics and communicational characteristics, logistics information systems. This study adapted concepts of trust and devotion as a factor for logistics cooperation. And the logistics cooperation was measured by logistics performance and logistics non-performance, This study verified research hypotheses by use of AMOS 4.0 programme as a model for structural equation. Survey was circulated to 851 public logistics participating firms which are located in Daejon 1,2,3,4 Industrial Complex, Cheongju 1,2,3,4 Industrial Complex, Oksan Industrial Complex, Ochang Science Industrial Complex, Daejon Noeun Agri Fishery Market. Among the 851, 238 (which is 27.9%) questionaries were answered and further 211 (24.7%) were selected as meaningful and used for empirical analysis.\\nThe analysis tested the hypotheses as follows.\\nFirst, firms characteristics and communicational characteristics, logistics information systems characteristics affected confidence.\\nSecond, only logistics information systems characteristics affected devotion.\\nThird, confidence affected devotion.\\nLastly confidence and devotion, respectively, affected performance positively.\\nThis hypotheses test leaves the following points : First, confidence is a prime element to form a devotion. And therefore a system shall be developed to make the firms trust each other.\\nSecond, cooperation for the public logistics affects the performance. And therefore the firms participating in the public logistics shall be recognized as horizontal partners not vertical.\\nThird, the participating firms are required to understand other firms\' corporate cultures along with operational features of public logistics, work standardization, fairness."}]},"fpage":"275","lpage":"307","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.275","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.006","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003095","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003086","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120 \ub300\ud615\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ub300\uc751 \ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Counter-strategies of Busan Port against Expansion of Container Vessel Size"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Counter-strategies of Busan Port against Expansion of Container Vessel Size"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc6d0\uc2b9\ud658(\uad70\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\uc131\uc6b0(\uad70\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc8fc\ud638(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc811\uadfc\uc131\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\uad6d \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc704\ud611\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ucd5c\uadfc\uc758 \ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc778\ud504\ub77c, \uc7a5\ube44, \uc6b4\uc601 \ub4f1\uc758 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uc751 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uc758 \ub300\ud615\ud654\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub9de\ucd98 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ub300\uc751 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uc120\ubc15 \ub300\ud615\ud654\uac00 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc120\ubc15\uc774 \ub300\ud615\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uae4a\uc740 \uc218\uc2ec\uc758 \ud655\ubcf4, \uc120\uc11d \uae38\uc774\uc758 \uc99d\uac00, \ud558\uc5ed\uc7a5\ube44 \uc0ac\uc591\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654, \ud558\uc5ed \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc758 \ud5a5\uc0c1 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5b4\uc11c \ucd5c\uadfc \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc785\ud56d\ud558\uc600\ub358 \uc120\ubc15 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc120\ubc15 \uc785\ud56d \ud604\ud669\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uace0 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ud604\uc7ac \uc120\ubc15 \uc218\uc6a9 \ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ud1a0\ub300\ub85c \uc120\ubc15 \ub300\ud615\ud654\uac00 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uac00\uc18d\ud654\ub420 \ubbf8\ub798\uc5d0 \ub300\ud615 \uc120\ubc15\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud560\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120 \ub300\ud615\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ub300\uc751 \ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \uc785\ucd9c\ud56d \ud574\ud611 \ubc0f \uc548\ubcbd\uc804\uba74\uc758 \uc218\uc2ec \ud655\ubcf4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc811\uc548 \uc870\uac74\uc758 \uac1c\uc120, \uc120\ubc15 \uae38\uc774\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc120\uc11d\uc758 \uc7ac\ubc30\uce58, \uc120\ud3ed \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud558\uc5ed\uc7a5\ube44 \uc0ac\uc591\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654, \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0 \ucc98\ub9ac\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ube44\ud55c \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc758 \ud601\uc2e0 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"As the size of trade between countries increased, there are rapid changes in the logistics environment concerning ports. The world container handling volume in 2013 is 642 million TEUs, which grew by 80 percent compared to 360 million TEUs in 2004. It is forecasted to reach 840 million TEUs in 2018, which grew by over 2 times compared to the amount in 2004. Due to this, the marine transportation industry has made Mega-Carrier appear through mergers and acquisitions between shipping lines to expand market dominance, and they are continuing to make enormous investments for securing mega ships over 10,000 TEUs in order to strengthen the competitiveness in shipping cost.\\nAccording to such changes in the shipping environment, large ports in the world are engaging in fierce competition for hub ports by continents in order to attract mega fleet, and this is leading to the trend of strengthening port competitiveness through the securing and operation of efficient port facilities. In other words, the world\u2019s leading ports such as Singapore, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Busan, Rotterdam, and Hamburg are not only developing large-sized terminals but also investing highly productive handling equipment for the efficiency of port operation.\\nBy the requirements of shipbuilders and shipping companies, very large container ships are becoming a reality, and 20,000 to 30,000 TEUs or more ultra large vessels are also expected a few years after. In these situations, the world\u2019s major ports are faced with important challenges. The provision of container terminal infrastructure has to be enhanced to reduce the time that vessels need to stay in port. It is imperative for container ports and individual terminals to be efficient in order to survive in today\u2019s competitive environment.\\nBusan Port has a very excellent accessibility to international intermodal transportation network but is facing a serious threat from the rapid growth of Chinese Ports. Now Busan Port needs the total counter-strategies considering infrastructure, equipment, and operation.\\nThe objective of this research is to propose the counter-strategies of Busan Port against growing container vessel size. In order to achieve the objective, we firstly summarize the effects of growing container vessel size on ports. The enlargement of vessels requires deeper water level, longer berth length, bigger container handling equipment, and higher handling productivity. Second, we analyze the calling situation of large container vessels at Busan Port by investigating the historical data of vessels which recently called at Busan Port, and also estimate the future status of Busan Port. Third, we also analyze the calling acceptability of large container vessels at Busan Port in the future based on the current calling conditions of Busan Port. Finally, we suggest the counter-strategies of Busan Port against the expansion of container vessel size based on the results of analyses: the improvement of berthing condition through keeping deeper water level of sea route and quay inside the ports, the rearrangement of berths according to longer vessel length, the specification acceptance of container handling equipment according to wider vessel width, and the innovative improvement of productivity against increasing the average handling amounts of vessels"}]},"fpage":"249","lpage":"274","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.249","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.010","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003086","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"06","volume":"31","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART002003076","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc \ud3d0\uc1c4\uc758 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc \ubd84\uc11d: X-\uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Spill-over Effects of the Port Shutdownfrom the Perspective of X-events"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Spill-over Effects of the Port Shutdownfrom the Perspective of X-events"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ubbfc\uaddc(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uae40\ucc2c\ud638(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc724\uc815\ud604(\uc11c\uc6b8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc815\uc0c1\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\uc601\uc740 \uad6d\uac00 \uacbd\uc81c \ubc1c\uc804\uc758 \ucd08\uc11d \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc704\uae30\uad00\ub9ac \uccb4\uacc4\uac00 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uad6c\ucd95\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \ud3d0\uc1c4\ub97c X-\uc774\ubca4\ud2b8\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ud558\uace0 \ud56d\ub9cc \ud3d0\uc1c4\uc758 \ucd09\ubc1c\uacbd\ub85c, \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc, \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud56d\ub9cc \ubb3c\ub958, \uc704\uae30 \ub300\uc751, X-\uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uad00\ub828 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ube0c\ub808\uc778\uc2a4\ud1a0\ubc0d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ub2e4\uc774\ub0b4\ubbf9\uc2a4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ud56d\ub9cc \ud3d0\uc1c4\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc81c\uc870\uc5c5, \uc5d0\ub108\uc9c0 \uc0b0\uc5c5, \ubb3c\ub958\u2027\uc720\ud1b5\uc5c5, \uad00\uad11\uc5c5 \ub4f1 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc804\ubc18\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0 \uac10\uc18c\uac00 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\uba70, \uc0ac\ud68c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\uc6a9 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc \uad6d\ubbfc \ubcf4\uac74\uc774 \uc704\ud611\uc744 \ubc1b\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc804\ub9dd\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc \ud3d0\uc1c4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \ub300\uc548\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\ubcc4 \ub300\uccb4\uc5ed\ub7c9 \ud655\ubcf4, \uc804\uc8fc\uae30\uc801 \uc704\uae30 \ub300\uc751 \uac70\ubc84\ub10c\uc2a4 \ub9c8\ub828, \ud56d\ub9cc \uc0ac\uace0 \ud45c\uc900\ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc \uad6c\ucd95 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \ud3d0\uc1c4\uc758 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ucc28\ub2e8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc704\uae30\uad00\ub9ac \uc815\ucc45 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud65c\uc6a9 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0 X-\uc774\ubca4\ud2b8 \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c \ub3c4\uc785\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc2a4\ud399\ud2b8\ub7fc\uc744 \ub113\ud788\ub294 \uacc4\uae30\uac00 \ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Generally, ports represent the major national infrastructure to ensure rapid and seamless transportation of import and export cargoes. For example, 99.7% of the volume of import and export cargoes in Korea was handled by marine transportation. Ports with normal operation state obviously play a pivotal role in national economic development. Thus, the port disruptions and shutdowns caused by unexpected accidents such as natural disasters or port transportation union strikes can generate negative impacts on the entire national economy. Meanwhile, recently social concerns for safety have grown gradually since unexpected tremendous accidents such as the roof collapse of resort located in Gyeongju, the Sewol ferry sinking, and the ventilation grate collapse in Pangyo Techno Valley took place one after the other in 2014. In accordance with these situations, the development of port risk management system for safety and resilience is certainly required.\\nThis study analyzed a variety of enablers, triggers, spill-over effects, and causal relationships of the port shutdown from the perspective of X-events. Given that X-events are defined as the extreme events induced by nature and human beings with severely low probability and enormous impacts, many researches on X-events mainly aim at developing early warning systems and preemptive correspondence strategies against new types of extreme events. With such background, this study carried out a round-table brainstorming session with various experts in port operation, logistics, risk management, and X-events and employed system dynamics methodology for drawing a scenario map and a causal loop of the port shutdown. Analysis results reveal that the port shutdown will lead to the decline in gross output of most industries which involve manufacturing, energy, logistics, construction, tourism, health care, and others. In addition, it is expected that the employment market situation and national health level will sequentially be threatened by the decline in production of many industries. Especially, the imbalance between supply and demand of energy and electricity is likely to provoke serious interruptions of electric service and social anxieties.\\nBased on analysis results, we suggest several policy instruments against the port shutdown - the preparation of elaborate contingency plans of port functions with designated substitute berths, the establishment of governance structures for port risk management through total periods, and the arrangement of the standardized manual on the port shutdown in charge of Ministry of Oceans and Fisheries. This study can be applied to the development of effective strategies for preventing the negative spill-over effects induced by the port shutdown and the preparation of optimal policy portfolios for port risk management. Furthermore, it is expected that analysis results will definitely provide significant sources pertaining to port safety policies. Finally, introducing the concept as well as methodology of X-events to the port logistics field for the first time will contribute to expanding the scope of the port logistics research."}]},"fpage":"227","lpage":"247","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.2.227","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.2.002","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART002003076","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"03","volume":"31","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001977538","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study of Risk Management Strategies for Korean Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study of Risk Management Strategies for Korean Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ub098\uc815\ud638(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uad11\uc6d0(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\uc778\uc801\uc790\uc6d0\uac1c\ubc1c\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\ubc29\ud76c\uc11d(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uad6d\ub0b4 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uae30\uc5c5\ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec, \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6d\ub0b4\uc678 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud604\ud669, \uad6d\ub0b4 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1a0\ub300\ub85c \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec AHP\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \uad6d\ub0b4 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd \uc81c\uace0\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uad6d\ub0b4 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\ud5d8 \uc804\ubb38 \uad00\ub9ac\ud300 \uac1c\uc124\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uc815\ubd80\ucc28\uc6d0\uc758 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub137\uc9f8, \uc720\ub3d9\uc131 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub300\ube44\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uccb4\uacc4\ub9c8\ub828\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc12f\uc9f8, \uc804\uc0ac\uc801 \uc758\uacac\uc870\uc728\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8\uad00\ub9ac \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4 \ub3c4\ucd9c\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548 \ub9c8\ub828\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc7a5\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to analyze Korean shipping company\'s risk management strategies, examine the risk factors for domestic shipping companies and to determine by a priority based system the companies characteristics.

interests of many in both an academic and practical field. However, despite its significance, the research on internationalization of Korean logistics firms has not actively progressed. For this reason, this research conducts an empirical analysis on the foreign subsidiary of Korean logistics firms. More specifically, this study examines the effects of internal and external network embeddedness on Performance of Korean Logistics Firm\u2019s Foreign Subsidiary.\\nBased on survey data from foreign subsidiaries of Korean logistics firms, the empirical results of this paper are as follows. First we have found out evidence that internal network embeddedness gives the positive effect on the performance of foreign subsidiaries. Such a result implies that in the case where the foreign subsidiary is deeply embedded within the internal network, the access, accumulation and utilization of useful resources within the internal network become easy, and that the subsidiary performance may improve due to the increase in bargaining power of the internal organization. Second, the external network embeddedness as well has positive influences on the subsidiary performance. This implies that the acquisition of host country-specific knowledge is better if the foreign subsidiary is deeply embedded in the external network of host country, and that it may increase the independence from the headquarters, improving the performance of foreign subsidiary.\\nThis research is considered to provide useful theoretical and practical implications that can contribute to enhancing the competitiveness of Korean logistics firms by explaining the significance of network embeddedness as determinants related to the subsidiary performance of Korean logistics firms."}]},"fpage":"141","lpage":"163","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.1.141","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.1.002","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001977524","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"03","volume":"31","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001977519","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\uc8fc\ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ud55c\ud611\uc57d\uc0c1 \uc120\ubcf5\uc6a9\uc120\uc790\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Scope of Slot Charterer under the LLMC"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Scope of Slot Charterer under the LLMC"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc815\uc900\uc2dd(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uacfc\uac70\ubd80\ud130 \uac01\uad6d\uc740 \uc790\uad6d\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ubcf4\ud638\uc721\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c5\uc790\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc8fc\ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ud55c\uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \uad6d\uc81c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud1b5\uc77c\ud55c \uac83\uc774 \uc120\uc8fc\ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ud55c\ud611\uc57d\uc774\ub2e4.

For this process, DEA(data envelopment analysis) has widely been used for efficiency analysis of decision making units(DMU) which is utilized as a main technique. 3 inputs(berth, marine transportation network, and logistics cost at container terminal) and 2 outputs(freight volume and betweenness centrality) that best represents the unique features of the hub-port are used for the analysis. The result of our analysis clearly shows that most Chinese ports have been operated with high efficiency except Hongkong, while Japanese ports are low in spite of their continued efforts. And Busan and Incheon port has been operated with high efficiency with Shanghai, Ningbo, Xiamen, and Dalian port."}]},"fpage":"107","lpage":"118","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.1.107","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.1.004","citation-count":"12","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001977515","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"03","volume":"31","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001977513","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud658\uacbd, \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Relationship between Environment, Market Orientation and Performance in Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Relationship between Environment, Market Orientation and Performance in Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud669\uacbd\uc5f0(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uad6c\uc885\uc21c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud55c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub0b4\uff65\uc678\ubd80\ud658\uacbd\uc774 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131\uc774 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\ud5a5\uc131\uc740 \uc9c0\uc2dd\ucc3d\ucd9c, \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc804\ud30c \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc751\uc73c\ub85c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \uccab\uc9f8, \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc744\uc218\ub85d \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc220\ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \ub354 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \uc678\ubd80\ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131\uc774 \uc2ec\ud560\uc218\ub85d \ub354 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ucd5c\uace0\uacbd\uc601\uc790\uac00 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ubab0\uc785\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \ub354 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \ub354 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ucd5c\uace0\uacbd\uc601\uc790\uac00 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ubab0\uc785\ud558\uace0 \uc9c1\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc801\uc778 \ud6c8\ub828 \uac15\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ub354 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud558\uace0, \ucc3d\ucd9c\ub41c \uc9c0\uc2dd\uc744 \uc804\ud30c\ud558\uba70, \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub354 \uc801\uadf9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\uc751\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc744\uc218\ub85d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study investigates the structural relationships between internal and external environment, market orientation, and firm\'s performance, focusing on the shipping industry in Korea.

Moreover micro index regarding faulty handling of engine facility, violation of navigational laws, improper ship maneuvering, carelessness of watch, and lack of response to stormy weather were introduced in the simulation model from 2004 to 2013. Using these factors, the Stock-Flow diagram procedure were obtained and after that the modelling of SD was established. In order to measure accuracy of the simulation, this study implemented MAPE analysis. And after the implementation, the simulation was decided as a much more accurate model because MAPE value was calculated to be within 10%. This study respectively examined factors using the sensitivity analysis. As a result, to reduce the ship accident, the factor named \u2018carelessness of watch\' is most significant followed by improper ship maneuvering, violation of navigational laws, faulty handling of engine facility, and lack of response to stormy weather."}]},"fpage":"29","lpage":"53","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.1.29","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.1.009","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001977505","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2015","pub-mon":"03","volume":"31","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001977499","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778: \ud328\ub110\uc911\ub825\ubaa8\ud615\uacfc \ud328\ub110 FMOLS\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"International Transport Structure and Determinants of Export Trading Volume in the Gwangyang Port: Application the Panel Gravity Model and Panel FMOLS"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"International Transport Structure and Determinants of Export Trading Volume in the Gwangyang Port: Application the Panel Gravity Model and Panel FMOLS"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\ucc3d\ubc94(\uc804\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uac1c\ubc1c\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad50\uc5ed\ub300\uc0c1\uad6d\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud55c \ud6c4 \uad11\uc591\ud56d \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud328\ub110\uc911\ub825\ubaa8\ud615\uacfc \ud328\ub110 FMOLS\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uc0c1\ub300\uad6d\uc758 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uaddc\ubaa8, \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uad6d\ub0b4\ucd1d\uc0dd\uc0b0 \uaddc\ubaa8, \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30 \ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \uc815\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc, \uc0c1\ub300\uad6d\uacfc\uc758 \uac70\ub9ac\uc640 \ubcc0\uc218\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc8fc\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4.

The gravity model includes variables for export trading volume, GDP of trading partners (CGDP), Korean GDP (KGDP), the distances between Korea and each trade partners, Baltic Dry Index (BDI) and the Howe Robinson Container Index (HRCI). Next, the Hausman test is employed to determine whether random effects or fixed effects estimation is more appropriate. This test examines the null hypothesis that unobserved omitted factors are correlated with the model\'s explanatory variables. As such, fixed effect estimation was founded to be suitable for this paper\'s model due to the rejection of the null hypothesis. An empirical analysis of the gravity model shows CGDP, KGDP and BDI have positive effects. Whereas, HRCI have negative effects. In addition, the results from the panel FMOLS tests show that export trading volume has a negative relationship with the HRCI."}]},"fpage":"5","lpage":"28","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2015.31.1.5","uci":"G704-000463.2015.31.1.008","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001977499","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"12","volume":"30","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001942805","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\ud611\ub825 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Interactive Effects of Environmental Collaboration on Performance of Korean Exporters"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Interactive Effects of Environmental Collaboration on Performance of Korean Exporters"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc30\ud76c\uc131(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc6b0\uc601(\uacbd\uc131\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc591\uae30(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \ud55c\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\ud611\ub825 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc131\uacfc, \uc6b4\uc601\uc131\uacfc \ubc0f \uc7ac\ubb34\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc218\ucd9c\uc5c5\uccb4\uc5d0 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. 219\uac1c\uc758 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud55c \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5 \uac04 \ud611\ub825\uc740 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac \uc804\uccb4\ub85c \ud655\uc0b0\ub418\uc5b4 \uacf5\uae09\uc790\uc640 \uace0\uac1d \uac04 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac15\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub294 \ub192\uc740 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc131\uacfc\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ud658\uacbd\uc804\ub7b5\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ud658\uacbd\ud611\ub825\uc740 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac \ucc38\uc5ec\uc790\ub4e4 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc5f0\uacc4\ub418\uace0 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub192\uc740 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacb0\ub41c\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ud658\uacbd\uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uc6b4\uc601\uc131\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\ub2a5\ub2e8\uc704\uc131\uacfc\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\uace0 \uc7ac\ubb34\uc131\uacfc\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\ub2e8\uc704 \uc131\uacfc\ub85c \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this research is to verify the interactive effect of environmental collaboration on environmental performance, operational performance and financial performance for green supply chain management. The results are as follows. First, the interactive effect of environmental collaboration enhances environmental performance. The high level of inter-functional collaboration concerned with environment can disseminate to whole supply chains and enhance the relationships with suppliers and customers, followed by the high level of environmental performance. Second, the interactive effect of environmental collaboration enhances operational performance. This means that environmental collaboration of Korean exporters can be connected with their supply chain participants and as a result, it is connected with high supply chain efficiency. Third, the relationship between the interactive effect of environmental collaboration and financial performance was not verified. However, environmental performance and operational performance have a positive influence on financial performance. Therefore, environmental performance and operational performance can be treated with functional level performance and financial performance can be shown as corporative level performance."}]},"fpage":"1043","lpage":"1068","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.4.1043","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.4.013","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001942805","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"12","volume":"30","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001942791","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\uc9c0 \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c - \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Selection Factors for Logistics Warehouse in Port hinterland - Focusing on Port of Incheon -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Selection Factors for Logistics Warehouse in Port hinterland - Focusing on Port of Incheon -"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc870\uc0c1\ud604(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ud638\uc601(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0 \uc218\uc694\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uacf5\uae09\uc774 \ub9ce\uc544\uc9c0\uac8c \ub418\uba74\uc11c \uacf5\uae09\uc218\uc694 \ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0\uc758 \ud654\uc8fc\uae30\uc5c5 \uc720\uce58\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. 1\ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c \uace0\ucc30\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601\uae30\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc758 In-depth Interview\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694\uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. 2\ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \uc8fc\uc694 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc778\ucc9c\ud56d \ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc8fc\ubcc0 \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0 \uc6b4\uc601\uae30\uc5c5 21\uac1c\uc0ac\uc758 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc758\uacac\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \ud37c\uc9c0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub958\ucc3d\uace0\uc758 \ud654\uc8fc\uae30\uc5c5 \uc720\uce58\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694\uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc, \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ube44\uc6a9, Service solution, \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc81c\ud488\uad00\ub9ac \ub4f1\uc744 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74\uc5d0 \ucc3d\uace0 \uc2dc\uc124\xb7\uc124\ube44, \uc7a5\ube44\xb7\ud3b8\ub9ac\uc131, \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108 \ub4f1\uc740 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Currently Port of Incheon is faced with an difficulty regarding the imbalance of logistics warehouse between supply and demand.

It was suggested that the petrochemical firms put the most weight on freight rate. However the group comparison showed clear difference. The firms using primarily tanker shipping perceived transportation quality more importantly but the firms using primarily container shipping evaluated freight rate more importantly.\\nThis study provides useful implications to maritime transport companies on factors petrochemical companies consider more important in choosing their transport service providers."}]},"fpage":"983","lpage":"1003","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.4.983","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.4.004","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001942755","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"12","volume":"30","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001942740","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ubd80\ub450 \ubc0f \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c\ubc29\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Development of International Passenger Wharf and Terminal in Pyeongtaek Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Development of International Passenger Wharf and Terminal in Pyeongtaek Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ub3d9\ud604(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc815\ud604\uc7ac(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ubd80\ub450 \ubc0f \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc740 2005\ub144\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc774\uc6a9\uac1d\uc758 \uc99d\uac00\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2dc\uc124 \ub0b4 \ud63c\uc7a1\ub3c4\uac00 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc774\uba70, \uc2dc\uc124 \uc218\uc6a9\ub2a5\ub825 \uc99d\ub300\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ubd80\ub450 \ubc0f \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uace0\ub824\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uae30\uc874 \uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 6\uac1c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uace0\ub824\uc694\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uacc4\uce35\ubd84\uc11d \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\ubc95(AHP)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ubd80\ub450 \ubc0f \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ud55c\xb7\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uacfc \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \u2018CIQ\uc758 \uc2dc\uc124 \ubc0f \uc778\ub825\ud655\ucda9\u2019\uc744 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud558\uc5ed\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc740 \u2018CY\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\u2019\ub97c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c CIQ\uc758 \uc2dc\uc124 \ubc0f \uc778\ub825\ud655\ucda9(0.268)\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc815\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uc6b4\ud56d\ud3b8\uc758(0.218), CY\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8(0.173)\uac00 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc815\ubd80 \ub2f9\uad6d\uc774 \ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ubd80\ub450 \ubc0f \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud568\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc790\ub8cc\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Congestion of international passenger wharf and terminal in pyeongtaek port has been serious by continuously increasing of users from 2005.

And we identified grant for shipbuilding finance, co-ownership with government and shipping company for LNG-powered ship as a short-term policy measures and reformation on the LNG-powered ship\u2019s space, usage standardization of LNG-powered ship as a long-term policy."}]},"fpage":"919","lpage":"938","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.4.919","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.4.010","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001942718","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"12","volume":"30","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001942706","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc591\uc7ac\ub09c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864 \ud0c0\uc6cc\uc758 \ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Fuzzy-AHP Analysis of Control Tower\u2019 Procedure to Marine Disaster"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Fuzzy-AHP Analysis of Control Tower\u2019 Procedure to Marine Disaster"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uac15\uc624\uc131(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc591\uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84 \uc778\uac04 \uacfc\uc2e4\uc774 \uc8fc\uc6d0\uc778\uc774\ub2e4. \ud574\uc591\uc7ac\ub09c\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud55c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc778\uba85\uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc7ac\uc0b0\ud53c\ud574 \ucd5c\uc18c\ud654, \uc7ac\ub09c \ud655\uc0b0 \ubc29\uc9c0\uc5d0 \ucd5c\uc120\uc744 \ub2e4\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \uad6d\uac00\uc758 \ucc45\ubb34\uc774\uace0 \uc5ed\ub7c9\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 Fuzzy-AHP \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ud0c0\uc6cc\uac00 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uc124\uacc4\ub294 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud574\uc591\uc7ac\ub09c \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ucee8\ud2b8\ub864\ud0c0\uc6cc\uac00 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c\ud558\ub294 \ubc18\uc751\uc131, \ubbfc\ucca9\uc131, \ud0c4\ub825\uc131, \uc548\uc804\uc131, \uc5f0\uacc4\uc131\uc758 5\uac1c \uce21\uc815\uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ubbfc\ucca9\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc774 28.9%\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, \ub458\uc9f8, 5\uac1c \uc9c0\ud45c\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ube44\uad50\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \ubc18\uc751\uc131\uc740 \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 53.4%, \ubbfc\ucca9\uc131\uc740 \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 56.8%, \ud0c4\ub825\uc131\uc740 \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 41.0%, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc740 \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 44.4%, \uc5f0\uacc4\uc131\uc740 \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 48.7%\uc774\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \ube44\uc728\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \uac00\uc911\uce58 \uc21c\uc704\ub97c \uc885\ud569\ud558\uba74 \uc5ed\uc2dc, \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 50.2%\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\uac83\uc740 \ud604\uc7a5\uc870\uce58\uac00 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\uace0 \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc774\uba70 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uacc4\uc131\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc73c\ub85c \uc791\ub3d9\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\uad6d, \uc2e4\uc81c \uac00\uc7a5 \ud639\ub3c5\ud55c \uc870\uac74\uc5d0 \uc801\uc6a9 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubbfc\ucca9\uc131 \uc788\ub294 \ud604\uc7a5 \uc870\uce58\uc758 \ub9e4\ub274\uc5bc \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Man-made errors often related to marine accidents. Therefore, when marine disaster happen, governments must handle and well manage in order to minimize casualties. Indeed, this is an important role of a government and the government should be able to prove its capability in case of emergency. This research is based on Fuzzy-AHP method and analyzes priority on countermeasures that an authority (or a control tower) must concern in case of emergency issues. In addition, Supply Chain Management Model was used in order to construct the research. There are five aspects that a control tower should be aware of in case of marine disaster: Responsiveness, Agility, Resilience, Robustness and Connectivity. The paper examined these five characteristics throughout this study. According to the research, three results were come out. First of all, importance of agility ranked at the top with 28.9%. Second, immediate actions on accidents construed as an especially important matter. For instance, the result of relative comparison between these five characteristics and immediate measures are as follows: responsiveness was 53.4%, and agility was 56.8%, and resilience was 41.0%. Thus, these results show that immediate and prompt actions are crucial in general. Third, in terms of weighted value, immediate measures rank at the top (50.2%) again and it indicates that prompt and quick measures at the field of accidents are important and should be working in systematic level that represents intimacy, resiliency, and connectivity. In conclusion, development of an immediate and agile procedure for such accident is highly required."}]},"fpage":"897","lpage":"918","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.4.897","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.4.001","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001942706","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"12","volume":"30","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001942688","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d \uc5f0\uad6c-H\ud574\uc6b4 \uc0ac\ub840-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Economies of Ship Scale and Container Shipping Cycle -A Case of H\xb7shipping Company-"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Economies of Ship Scale and Container Shipping Cycle -A Case of H\xb7shipping Company-"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc724\uc885\ud601(\ud55c\uc9c4\ud574\uc6b4)","\uc624\uc6a9\uc2dd(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \uc2dc\ud669\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac00\uc815 \ud558\uc5d0 \uc774\uc758 \uac80\uc99d\uc744 \ubaa9\ud45c\ub85c \uc791\uc131\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 3\ub144\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\ud56d\uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc640 \ub2e8\uc704\ube44\uc6a9, \uc2dc\ud669\uacfc\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ucc29\ubaa9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\uc99d\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc120\ubc15\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ud55c\ubc88 \uc785\uc99d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e4\ub9cc \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\ud669\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc740 \ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubbf8\ubb18\ud55c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc989, \ubd81\ubbf8\uc11c\uc548\ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac70\uc758 \uc2dc\ud669\uc5d0 \uad00\uacc4\uc5c6\uc774 \uac15\ub825\ud55c \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ubc1c\uacac\ub418\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc720\ub7fd\ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd88\ud669\uae30\uc5d0 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In this study, we tried to verify the hypothesis of changing ship scale economies based on shipping cycle.

First of all, export competitiveness indices are applied to examine the comparative advantage of service trade structure using the WTO and OECD data. Also, the standard time-series method used to identify the determinants of transportation service export. Johansen cointegraion results indicate that there is a long-run relationship between export and variables. Cointegrating equation (CCR, FMOLS, DOLS) methodologies provide a check for the robustness of results and have the ability to produce reliable estimates in small sample sizes. The empirical analysis of cointegrating vector reveals that the rise of REER has strongly negative relation with export. Whereas, other variables have positive relation with export. In addition, this paper analyzes the dynamic causal relationship between these variables using the dynamic vector using Johansen\'s multiple cointegration procedure. The dynamic causality results reveal there exists bidirectional causality between service export and commodity export. Another result indicates that world economy activity is found to Granger cause service export."}]},"fpage":"801","lpage":"823","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.4.801","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.4.011","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001942599","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"09","volume":"30","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001915356","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"System Dynamics\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc120\uc6d0\uc778\ub825 \uc218\uae09 \uc608\uce21 \ubc0f \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Forecasting and suggesting strategies for smooth marine seafarers\' supply and demand using System Dynamics method"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Forecasting and suggesting strategies for smooth marine seafarers\' supply and demand using System Dynamics method"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ud638\uc601(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc804\uc900\uc6b0(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544\ubb3c\ub958\ub300\ud559\uc6d0 \uc11d\uc0ac\uacfc\uc815)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 System Dynamics \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\uc6d0\uc778\ub825\uc758 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc218\uae09\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. 2020\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc120\uc6d0\uc778\ub825 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc120\uc6d0\uc778\ub825\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc120\uc6d0\uc778\ub825\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc784\uae08, \ubcf5\uc9c0\uc81c\ub3c4, \uc120\uc6d0\uad50\uc721\uae30\uad00, \uc721\uc0c1\uadfc\ub85c\uc790 \uc784\uae08\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc2dc\ub098\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \uc120\uc6d0\uad50\uc721\uae30\uad00\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc120\uc6d0\uc778\ub825 \ud655\ucda9 \ubc29\uc548\uc740 \ud6a8\uacfc\uac00 \ubbf8\ube44\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc120\uc6d0 \ubcf5\uc9c0 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uae08\uc561\uacfc \ud3c9\uade0\uc784\uae08\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud588\uc744 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc120\uc6d0\uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc721\uc0c1\uc784\uae08\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud560 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc774\uc9c1\ud558\ub294 \uc120\uc6d0 \uc218\uac00 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc5ec \uc721\uc0c1\uc784\uae08 \ub300\ube44 \uc120\uc6d0 \uc784\uae08\uc744 \uc870\uc808\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this research is to suggest the strategies for smooth marine seafarers\' supply and demand by adopting System Dynamics method.

For scenario analysis, variables such as average wage of seafarer, average wage of worker who employed on land based companies, welfare system and educational institution for seafarers, were used. As a results, effects of increasing the educational institution are limited while effects of average wage of seafarer and welfare system can make a difference.

yet. Accordingly the shipping industry has been influenced by reduced quantity of goods transported vastly. At this moment, this study could be proper to overcome this crisis in some way in shipping industry, especially in chemical taker market. A positive analysis of management and operation of chemical tanker has not been actively studied internationally and domestically due to relatively its small market, compared to its market value. This study could be a very important touchstone for more positive study even though it is defined in Asian market which is so-called World\'s factory. This study is dependant on regression analysis. A number of chemical cargo, calling port, sea speed, etc are independent variables, while cargo loading tonnage rate, layday, and fuel consumption rate are dependant variables. Since the chemical tanker is different from crude oil tanker, it should load diverse cargos in many cargo holds at the same voyage, which means that the volume of economy with the single cargo cannot be achieved due to its characteristic diverse cargo and small size. The result of the analysis, relating to the size of chemical tanker, suggests that in Asian market a medium-size chemical tanker is more appropriate relatively. As a result, for chemical tanker operators and managers, this is very important consequences to make a voyage and stowage plan, a new building or chartering design. As a comparison study, this would also contribute to the effects of empirical studies henceforth."}]},"fpage":"741","lpage":"758","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.3.741","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.3.007","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001915354","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"09","volume":"30","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001915352","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud30c\ub098\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud558 \ud655\uc7a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Competitiveness Analysis on Global Transportation Route in view of the Panama Canal Expansion"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Competitiveness Analysis on Global Transportation Route in view of the Panama Canal Expansion"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud55c\ucca0\ud658(\ub3d9\uc11c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc11c\uc218\uc644(\ub3d9\uc11c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud30c\ub098\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud558\uc758 \ud655\uc7a5 \uacf5\uc0ac\uac00 \uc644\ub8cc\ub41c \uc774\ud6c4 \ud30c\ub098\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud558\uacbd\uc720 \uacbd\ub85c, \uc218\uc5d0\uc988\uc6b4\ud558\uacbd\uc720 \uacbd\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubd81\ubbf8 \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub85c\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud574 \ubcf4\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\ubcc4 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uac70\ub9ac, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc2dc\uac04, \uc6b4\uc1a1\ube44\uc6a9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ub098\uc544\uac00 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ud30c\ub098\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud558\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce60 \ubc99\ucee4\uc720\uac00\uaca9\uacfc \uc6b4\ud558\ud1b5\ud589\ub8cc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \uac70\ub9ac\uc640 \uc2dc\uac04 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc544\uc2dc\uc544\ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubbf8\uad6d \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc720\ub9ac\ud55c \ubc18\uba74, \uc6b4\uc1a1\ube44\uc6a9\uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\uc5d0\uc988\uc6b4\ud558\ub97c \uacbd\uc720\ud558\ub294 \uacbd\ub85c\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \ud30c\ub098\ub9c8\uc6b4\ud558\ub294 \ubc99\ucee4\uc720\uac00\uaca9\uc774 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud560\uc218\ub85d \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud1b5\ud589\ub8cc \uc778\uc0c1\ud3ed\uc774 \ucee4\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \ud0c0 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacbd\ub85c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uc57d\ud654\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to analyze the Asia - U.

The number of mega sized container ships is increasing rapidly since 2004. Recently, according to a leading shipping and port experts forecasted preparations for the construction of a 24,000 TEU container ship, which is 5,000 TEU bigger than the current largest vessel, could start in 2016. Many global ports are ready for accommodating mega sized container ships. Productivity of each gantry crane in Busan Port is maximum 30 moves per hour, and the average number of cranes are six per above 13,000 TEU ship. When a 24,000 TEU mega sized vessel enters a port, the cargo handling time of this ship is not within 24 hours. In order to handle containers of 24,000 TEU within 24 hours, container terminals need fundamental innovation in technology for processing containers. Therefore, this paper introduced the new concept container terminal, HOSS(Horizontal Overhead Shuttle System) and described the characteristics and strengths of this system. This HOSS has two major benefits. First, the HOSS has a good berth productivity and more stack containers in yard compared to the same size of current container terminal in Busan. Second, it is divided into vertical and horizontal direction for transporting containers to reduce the bottleneck of container traffic."}]},"fpage":"671","lpage":"696","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.3.671","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.3.003","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001915323","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"09","volume":"30","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001915320","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\xb7\uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974 FTA\uc640 \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \ub300 \uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Korea-Singapore FTA and Export Logistics to Singapore via Gwangyang Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Korea-Singapore FTA and Export Logistics to Singapore via Gwangyang Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ucc3d\ubc94(\uc804\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uac1c\ubc1c\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c)","\ubaa8\uc218\uc6d0(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uad11\ubc30(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8\uace0\ub294 1991\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2013\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ud45c\uc900\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4 \ubd84\uc11d\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c\xb7\uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974 FTA\uac00 \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \ub300 \uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc804\ud5a5\uc801 \uc774\ub3d9\ud68c\uadc0 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc 2013\ub144 \uc774\ud6c4 \ud658\uc728\uacc4\uc218\ub294 \ucee4\uc9c0\uace0 \uacbd\uae30\uacc4\uc218\ub294 \uc791\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c FTA\uacc4\uc218\uac00 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucee4\uc838 \ud55c\xb7\uc2f1\uac00\ud3ec\ub974 FTA\uac00 \uc218\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \uc810\ucc28 \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubca1\ud130\uc624\ucc28\uc218\uc815\ubaa8\ud615\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucda9\uaca9\ubc18\uc751\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, \ud658\uc728\ucda9\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\uac00 \ucda9\uaca9 \ud6c4 6\uac1c\uc6d4\uae4c\uc9c0\ub294 \uc99d\uac00\ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098 7\uac1c\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130\ub294 \uac10\uc18c \ubc18\uc751\uc73c\ub85c \ubc14\ub010 \ud6c4 \uadf8 \ud06c\uae30\uac00 \uc810\ucc28 \ucee4\uc838 \ud658\uc728\uc0c1\uc2b9\ucda9\uaca9\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc218\ucd9c\uc99d\uac00\ub294 \uae30\ub300\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub835\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacbd\uae30\ucda9\uaca9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ucda9\uaca9 2\uac1c\uc6d4 \ud6c4\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud070 \uc99d\uac00\ubc18\uc751\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778 \ud6c4 9\uac1c\uc6d4\uae4c\uc9c0\ub3c4 \uc591\uc758 \ubc18\uc751\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uc5ec \uacbd\uae30\uc0c1\uc2b9\uc774 \uc218\ucd9c\ubb3c\ub958\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0 \uae30\uc5ec\ud568\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc5c8\ub2e4.

All series span the period January 1991 to December 2013. We first test whether the series are stationary or not. We can reject the null hypothesis of a unit root in each of the level variables and of a cointegrating relation using the augmented Dickey-Fuller test and the Johansen\'s multivariate cointegrating procedures at the 5 percent significance level. The error correction term demonstrates that the short-run data generating process includes pressures to adjust toward long-run equilibrium. The error correction coefficient is significantly estimated to be 0.091. Also, the impulse response functions based on VECM(vector error correction model) indicate that export increases in a great magnitude to shocks in Korea-Singapore FTA and decays very slowly."}]},"fpage":"655","lpage":"670","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.3.655","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.3.002","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001915320","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"09","volume":"30","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001915317","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubc8c\ud06c\uc120 \uc6b4\uc784\uacfc \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\uc758 \uc778\uacfc\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Causality Test of the Relationship between the Freight Indexes and the Ship Prices in Second-hand Bulk Market"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Causality Test of the Relationship between the Freight Indexes and the Ship Prices in Second-hand Bulk Market"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uba85\ud76c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uae30\ud658(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc9c0\uc601(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubca1\ud130\uc790\uae30\ud68c\uadc0(Vector Autoregressive, VAR)\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc8c\ud06c\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc784\uacfc \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc120\ub839 5\ub144, 10\ub144\uc744 \uae30\uc900\ud55c capesize, panamax\uae09 \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\uc640 BDI, BCI, BPI \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c 2000\ub144 1\uc6d4\ubd80\ud130 2014\ub144 2\uc6d4\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uc6d4\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\ub294 \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\ub294 \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ucda9\uaca9\ubc18\uc751\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc624\ucc28\ubd84\ud574\ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b4\uc784\uc9c0\uc218\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc740 2\uac1c\uc6d4 \ud6c4\uc758 \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud06c\uac8c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc8fc\uba70 \uc774 \ucda9\uaca9\uc740 12\uac1c\uc6d4 \ud6c4\uc5d4 \uac70\uc758 \uc18c\uba78\ub418\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. panamax\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0ac\uc774\uc988\uac00 \ud070 capecsize\uae09 \uc120\ubc15\uc774, \uc120\ub839\uc774 \ub192\uc740 \uc120\ubc15(10\ub144)\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc120\ub839\uc774 \ub0ae\uc740 \uc120\ubc15(5\ub144)\uc774 \uc6b4\uc784 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \uc911\uace0\uc120 \uac00\uaca9\uc774 \ub354 \ud06c\uac8c \ubc18\uc751\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc911\uace0\uc120\uac00\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 panamax\uae09 \uc120\ubc15\uc740 BDI\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 BPI\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0, capesize\uae09 \uc120\ubc15\uc740 BCI\ubcf4\ub2e4 BDI\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub354 \ud06c\uac8c \ubcc0\ud654\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"We test dynamic relationship between the freight indexes and the ship prices in second-hand bulk market using VAR(Vector Autoregressive) model.

The result of causality analysis shows that the freight indexes have an impact on the ship prices, while the ship prices do not impact the freight indexes. We find that at the time of two months, the response of the ship prices to the impulse of the freights is the strongest and disappear in twelve months. This paper also shows that the change of the capesize vessel prices is stronger than that of the panamax and the price of the ten-year vessels responds weaker than that of five-year by the fluctuation of the each freight indexes.

In the analysis process, we reclassified 30 sectors in the high classification level of the input-output table into 28 sectors by matching between freight items of SP-IDC and sectors in the input-output table. Moreover, we produced maritime volume inducing effects by applying maritime volume basic units to the export inducing and import inducing effects. The results show that the correlation coefficient between export inducing effects and maritime export volume inducing effects is only 0.45, but the value between import inducing effects and maritime import volume inducing effects is 0.92. Sectors with large maritime export and import volume inducing effects are revealed as \u2018petroleum and coal products\', \u2018textiles and leather products\', \u2018chemical and allied products\' and \u2018non-metallic mineral products.\' Finally, it is expected that analysis results will contribute to helping in forecasting maritime volume according to the government based projects."}]},"fpage":"617","lpage":"635","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.3.617","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.3.001","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001915309","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"09","volume":"30","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001915304","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"BSC, DEA\uc640 Malmquist \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9 \uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Integration of Balanced Scorecard, Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist Productivity Index for Benchmarking Management of Korean Shipping Company"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Integration of Balanced Scorecard, Data Envelopment Analysis and Malmquist Productivity Index for Benchmarking Management of Korean Shipping Company"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uad6c\uc885\uc21c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c DEA Malmquist \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \uc9c0\uc218\uc640 BSC\ub97c \uacb0\ud569\ud558\uc5ec BSC\uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0, \uc5f0\ub3c4\ubcc4 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c 23\uac1c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uadfc 5\ub144(2009\ub144~2013\ub144)\uac04 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uc2e4\uc99d \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, 1\ub2e8\uacc4 \ud559\uc2b5 \ubc0f \uc131\uc7a5-\ub0b4\ubd80\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120 \ubc0f \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 \ub9e4\ub144 13.7%, 8.0%, 10.7% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. 2\ub2e8\uacc4 \ub0b4\ubd80\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4-\uace0\uac1d \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120\uacfc \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 \ub9e4\ub144 3.1%, 3.4% \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c \ubc18\uba74, \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub9e4\ub144 0.4% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. 3\ub2e8\uacc4 \uace0\uac1d-\uc7ac\ubb34 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \ubc8c\ud06c\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c \ub9e4\ub144 15.7% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub09c \ubc18\uba74, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\uacfc \ud0f1\ucee4\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uac01\uac01 \ub9e4\ub144 5.9%, 4.7% \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0\uac8c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study employs data envelopment analysis (DEA) to examine the productivity\u2014Malmquist productivity index\u2014 changes of 23 shipping companies in Korea for the period 2009-2013 using their Balanced Scorecard (BSC). A 3-step efficiency analysis model was suggested based on the framework of BSC: learning and growth-internal process, internal process-customer, and customer-finance. In the first step, the study calculated the productivity changes by using internal process prospective as output variable and learning and growth prospective as input variable, in which the productivity of bulk, container and tanker ship companies has decreased 13.7%, 8.0% and 10.7% annually, respectively. The results of the second step analysis that puts customer prospective as output variable and internal processes prospective as input variable to calculate the productivity show that the productivity of bulk and container ship companies has increased 3.1% and 3.4% annually, respectively, and that the productivity of tanker ship companies has decreased 0.4% annually. The third step analysis results, focused calculation based on financial prospective (output variable) and customer prospective (input variable), show that the productivity of container and tanker ship companies has increased 5.9% and 4.7% annually, respectively and that the productivity of bulk ship companies has decreased 15.7% annually.

Subsequently, the six sub-factors in each of six major areas were identified so that total 24 sub-factors were used for the analysis. By adopting AHP technique, the prioritizing of the 24 sub-factors was determined.\\nThe results of AHP analysis showed as follows; Firstly, the trade expansion would be slightly more important than the logistics expansion for the bilateral relationship between Korea and Indonesia. Secondly, the top six factors required for the expansion of Korea\u2019s share in the Indonesian trade and logistics markets included steel products (0.067), mineral fuels (0.066), constructing highways and railroads (0.064), oil and gas development (0.061), electrical machinery (0.52), construction of seaport and airport terminals (0.051).\\nThe analytical results have enabled to form the

relationship between types of internationalization experience and financial performance of Korean logistics firms. Specifically, this research examines the types of international experience such as the depth of international experience and the breadth of international experience of Korean logistics firms. The depth of international experience is measured as the number of years since the focal firm\u2019s first foreign expansion through foreign direct investment and it represents the years that took the firm to reach its current international expansion. The breadth of international experience is measured as the number of subsidiaries in which a firm established subsidiaries during its international expansion. Thus, we attempt to explain the types of international experience in terms of learning acquired in the course of past international activities and its impact on performance of the firms.\\nBased on organizational learning theory, we presents two hypotheses. Hypothesis 1 suggests that a higher depth of accumulated experience in international markets will have a positive influence on the financial performance of Korean logistics firms. Hypothesis 2 anticipates that Korean logistics firm\'s the diversity of international market experience is positively related to the financial performance of Korean Logistics Firms.\\nBased on the sample of port logistics, land logistics, transportation service firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE) for the period of 1980-2006, the results showed that the types of international experience of Korean logistics firms are positively related to financial performance of logistic firms. This paper investigates the relationship between the depth of breadth of international experience based on organizational learning theory. The results of our longitudinal study suggest that the types of international experience promotes the organizational learning by exposing the firm to rich and diverse experiences, and consequently have positive impact on firm\'s performance."}]},"fpage":"517","lpage":"538","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.2.517","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.2.003","citation-count":"11","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001888802","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"06","volume":"30","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001888792","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Fuzzy-AHP\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Revitalization of Short Sea Shipping using Fuzzy-AHP"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Revitalization of Short Sea Shipping using Fuzzy-AHP"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc0c1\uc5f4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\ud638(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50 \uad6d\uc81c\uc804\ubb38\ub300\ud559\uc6d0)","\uc7a5\ud604\ubbf8(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uc740 \uace0\ud6a8\uc728, \uce5c\ud658\uacbd \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc218\ub2e8\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\ubb3c\uc790 \ubc0f \ub300\ub7c9\ud654\ubb3c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5d0\uc11c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uac70\ub9ac\uac00 \uc9e7\uace0 \ub0b4\ub959\uc218\ub85c\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc5ec\uac74\uc774 \uac16\ucd94\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc0c1 \ub3c4\ub85c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ud574 \ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uce21\uba74\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud654\ubb3c\uc218\uc1a1\ubd84\ub2f4\ub960\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uc548\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub294 \uce5c\ud658\uacbd Modal Shift \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \ub3c4\ub85c\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc911\uc2ec \uad6d\uac00\ubb3c\ub958\uccb4\uacc4\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \uce5c\ud658\uacbd \ubb3c\ub958\uccb4\uacc4\uc758 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc815\ubd80\ub294 \uc804\ud658\uad50\ud1b5 \ubcf4\uc870\uae08 \uc81c\ub3c4 \ub4f1\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\ub85c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc548\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc804\ud658\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \uadf8 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ub300\ud558\uae30\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c, \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc5f0\uc548\uc6b4\uc1a1 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub97c Fuzzy-AHP\uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec, \uc120\ubcc4\uc801, \uc9d1\uc911\uc801 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc790\uc6d0\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ud65c\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45 \uae30\ucd08\uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \uc694\uc18c \uc911 \ube44\uc6a9(0.35)\uacfc \uc778\ud504\ub77c \uc694\uc18c(0.277)\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uc138\ubd80\uc694\uc18c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uac00 \uc720\ub958\ube44(\uba74\uc138\uc720) \uc9c0\uc6d0(0.134), \ud56d\ub9cc\uc2dc\uc124\ub8cc \uac10\uba74 \ud655\ub300(0.116), \ud56d\ub9cc \ubc0f \ud558\uc5ed\uc7a5\ube44 \uc9c0\uc6d0(0.113), \ubb3c\ub958\ubcf4\uad00\ucc98\ub9ac\uc2dc\uc124\uc9c0\uc6d0(0.104)\uc758 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Short Sea Shipping (SSS) is a logistics concept defined as commercial waterborne that uses inland and coastal waterways to move containers, trailers, general cargo and bulk, not transiting an ocean. As an integral part of the supply chain, SSS plays a vital role in alleviating congestion and environmental pollution in highways by providing a more sustainable mode of transport. However, SSS in South Korea records a negative growth due to the inefficiency arising from the short transport distances and the limited inland waterway systems as compared to road transport. Despite Korean government\'s effort to shift the transport mode from road to short sea shipping including modal shift subsidy scheme, its effect has not been demonstrated yet. Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the relative importance and priorities of factors contributing to success of SSS by employing Fuzzy-AHP. According to the results, factors related to the cost (0.35) and infrastructure (0.277) were revealed as most important. The subsidy for the price of oil(tax-free oil) (0.134) was selected as the most critical sub-factor, followed by the expansion of reducing port facility fees (0.116), the support for port and cargo handling equipment (0.113) and for the logistics warehousing facilities (0.104).

In the past, the two nations were in cooperative relationship when it comes to division of labor. However, now it has turned into competitive relationship. As China has achieved advancement of its industrial infrastructure, the country has been trying to produce intermediary products locally. Most exports from Gwangyang port are petrochemicals and exports to China takes 22% from the total ratio. Also, Korea-China FTA is about to be prepared. This agreement includes negotiation of general, sensitive and super sensitive areas. Therefore, there has been a change in competition when it comes to exports of major products via the port. Consequently, this study is conducted by analyzing statistics. Thus, the study is conducted by using TSI(trade specialization index), IITI(intra-industry trade index), competition pattern analysis, and contribution ratio to trade of balance in order to examine comparative advantage. According to the research, items that changedto SQC and maintained the competitive advantage for quality are increased. Also, majority of IITI(intra-industry trade) were horizontal intra-industry trade which shares similar quality, but different from product attribute. In addition, compare to 2008 and 2012,contribution ratio to trade of balancees calated in general. Also, this research studied comparative advantage on trade with China and 4 out of 8 items were identified as SQC(successful quality competition) and the others were recognized as SPC(successful price competition). According to the overall analyze of Gwangyang port, horizontal IITI was most common and criinonitrill butadiene styrene showed the most trade surplus record. Flat-rolled product (4.75mm above and less below 10mm) analyzed as the most trade deficit category. Consequently, exports to China in Gwangyang port has comparative advantage, but it is not very clear because this comparative advantage is a mixture of price and quality measures. Thus, in order to increase capacity-especially in case of Korea-China FTA- high value products should be developed by technical innovation."}]},"fpage":"451","lpage":"466","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.2.451","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.2.001","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001888781","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"06","volume":"30","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001888775","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d \uc0c1\ud574\uc9c0\uc5ed \ud654\uc8fc\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc790 \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Selection Factors for Freight Forwarder of the Shippers in Shanghai, China"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Selection Factors for Freight Forwarder of the Shippers in Shanghai, China"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc2e0\ucc3d\ud6c8(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc815\ub3d9\ud6c8(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\ud76c\uac00\ud61c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc804 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uad6d \ubb34\uc5ed\ud65c\ub3d9\uc774 \ud65c\ubc1c\ud574 \uc9d0\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc138\uacc4 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uad6d\uac00\ub4e4\uc740 \uc911\uad6d \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c4\ucd9c\uc744 \uaf80\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad6d\uac00 \uac04 \ubb34\uc5ed\uc758 \uadfc\uac04\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5 \ubd80\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uadf8 \uc601\uc5ed\uc774 \uc810\ucc28 \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4.\\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \uc0c1\ud574\uc9c0\uc5ed \ud654\uc8fc\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac\uc640 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc870\uc0ac\uc640 \uc804\ubb38\uac00 \uc778\ud130\ubdf0\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc138\ubd80\ud56d\ubaa9\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c \ud55c \ud6c4 \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc885\uc18d\ubcc0\uc218\ub97c \ud654\uc8fc\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4, \ucda9\uc131\ub3c4, \uae30\uc5c5\uc131\uacfc\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ud654\uc8fc\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4\ub85c \ub2e4\uc911\ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \uc0c1\ud574\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ud654\uc8fc\uc5c5\uccb4\ub4e4\uc774 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4 \uc120\ud0dd\uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud654\uc8fc\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ucd94\ud6c4 \uad6d\ub0b4 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc911\uad6d \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \uc9c4\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc5f0\uad6c \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Recently, China\'s trade activities are increasing and other countries are entering the chinese market. Due to this reason, freight forwarder\u2019s business sectors are increasingly expanding. The aim of this paper is to assess shipper\u2019s selection factors to use freight forwarders. Before the empirical analysis, first, we drew the detailed selection factors of freight forwarders through literature reviews and specialist interviews. Second, we used regression analyses using dependent variables (satisfaction, loyalty, business performance) about each activity area of shippers. Through the analysis, we could show the shipper\u2019s criteria about freight forwarder\u2019s selection factors.

The research model was designed through Fuzzy-AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process) methodology. The model was established by exploiting a fuzzy theory and AHP for capturing the inexactness and vagueness of information. In this study, measurement areas were selected for information gathering of inventory and demand aspect, supply and demand plan aspect, and supply and demand management aspect.\\nThe information gathering of inventory and demand aspect is the highest priority in the considering stock status by port & regional(39.2%), the supply and demand plan aspect is the highest priority in the relocation of empty container(40.4%) and the supply and demand management aspect is the highest priority in the container lease(29.9%). In the result of the comprehensive analysis applying global weight, The most important element of the efficient supply and demand control of empty container was a considering stock status by port & regional."}]},"fpage":"365","lpage":"379","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.2.365","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.2.002","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001888751","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865832","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \ud558\uc5ed\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uacfc \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Study on problems and solution of Automobile Loading and Unloading Process in Pyeongtaek Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Study on problems and solution of Automobile Loading and Unloading Process in Pyeongtaek Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ud559\uc218(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300)","\uc120\uc77c\uc11d(\uc7a5\uc548\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc548\uc2b9\ubc94(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud3c9\ud0dd\ud56d \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \ud558\uc5ed\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ud558\uc5ed\uc791\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \uc0ac\uc5c5\uccb4 \uadfc\ubb34\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac \uacb0\uacfc \uc791\uc5c5\uc778\ub825 \uc758\uc2dd\uc218\uc900(\ucc45\uc784\uc758\uc2dd \uacb0\uc5ec), \uc57c\ub4dc \uc218\uc6a9\ub2a5\ub825 \ubd80\uc871(\ud558\uc5ed\uc791\uc5c5 \ub2a5\ub960 \uc800\ud558), \uc791\uc5c5\uc778\ub825 \uc219\ub828\ub3c4(\uc0ac\uace0\uc728 \uc99d\uac00), \ub178\ub3d9\uc870\ud569 \ud615\ud0dc(\uc778\ub825\uacf5\uae09 \uad6c\uc870 \ubcc0\ud654), \ubc30\ud6c4\ubd80\uc9c0 \ubd80\uc871(\ud654\ubb3c \ubc18\ucd9c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0), \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uac04 \uc120\ubc15\uc774\ub3d9(\ud558\uc5ed\uac00\ub2a5\uc2dc\uac04 \uac10\uc18c), \uace0\uc815\ub41c \uc791\uc5c5\uc2dc\uac04 \ubc30\uc815(\ud654\ubb3c\uc885\ub958\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud558\uc5ed\ud6a8\uc728 \uc800\ud558) \ub4f1\uc774 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud558\uc5ed/\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc6b4\uc601\uc5c5, \uc120\uc0ac \ubc0f \ub300\ub9ac\uc810, \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28 \uc218\ucd9c/\uc218\uc785\uc5c5\uc790, \ud56d\ub9cc\uac80\uc218/\uace0\ubc15\uc5c5/\uc6a9\uc5ed\uc5c5 \ub4f1 4\uac1c \uc9d1\ub2e8\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 ANOVA(\uc77c\uc6d0\ubc30\uce58 \ubd84\uc0b0\ubd84\uc11d)\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud558\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810, \ud558\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548 \ub4f1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud558\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ubcf5\uc218 \ud558\uc5ed \uc6b4\uc601\uc0ac(\ud558\uc5ed\uc0ac \uac04 \ud611\uc870\ubd80\uc871), \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uac04 \uad50\ucc28\uc791\uc5c5(\uc81c\ud55c\uc801 \uc791\uc5c5\uc2dc\uac04), \ubc30\ud6c4\ubd80\uc9c0 \ubd80\uc871(\ud654\ubb3c \ubc18\ucd9c \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0), POOL\uc778\ub825 \uc870\ub2ec\ubd80\uc871(\ubb3c\ub7c9\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0), \uc791\uc5c5\uc778\ub825 \uc758\uc2dd\uc218\uc900(\ucc45\uc784\uc758\uc2dd \uacb0\uc5ec) \ub4f1\uc774 \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ud558\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870 \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud558\uc5ed\ud1b5\ud569\uc6b4\uc601, \uc791\uc5c5\uc778\ub825 \uacf5\uae09\ud68c\uc0ac \uc124\ub9bd, \ubc30\ud6c4\ubd80\uc9c0 \uac1c\ubc1c \ub4f1\uc758 \uac1c\uc120\ucc45\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9d1\ub2e8 \uac04\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In order to draw problems and improvements of loading/unloading automobile in Pyeongtaek Port, this study conducted a survey for workers related to loading/unloading work, and then analyzed the differences in cognition among groups.

When LCC just entered domestic air transportation market in Korea, there are many worries such as safety, reliability, and operation. These worries have come true since there were many cancellations of air flights because poor maintenance, scheduling, and operation. Moreover, customers demand for same service to LCC with Full Service Airline (FSA) while they expect to pay low fare.\\nNevertheless, LCC have increased it market share in air transportation market in Korea since interests in air transportation demand for no-frills have increased. In 2013, a market share of LCC on Gimpo-Jeju route reached 59.3 percent which is the highest after its entrance in the market. LCC pursues a lower cost structure compared to FSA. LCC does not service newspapers, soda, entertainment and tries to simplify its organization, information, and service to maximize profit by reducing total costs while they offer lower fares compared to FSA.\\nIt is expected that a growth in LCC will be continued because of increases in air transportation market and in consumers\' demand for LCC. Especially, seat supply for Jeju route has been increasing since Korean LCC focus on their flights in the route and there is imbalance between seat supply and demand.\\nLow fares may increase travel demands in two ways. One is \\"Substitution effect\\" and another one is \\"Creation effect.\\" Substitution effect is a effect of LCC on demand increases by who travels Jeju instead of oversea because of low fares. Creation effect is a effect of LCC on demand increases by who travels Jeju instead of inland sightseeing because of low costs of air transportation.\\nThere are only few studies empirically analyzing this issue while there are many previous studies about operation strategies of LCC. The objective of this study is to estimate effects of LCC on air transportation demands in Korea, especially in Jeju route. Two Stage Budgeting with Almost Ideal Demand System is used to estimate the effects.\\nIt is found that LCC substitutes exiting air transportation demands for FSA and create new air transportation demands for Jeju route based on lower fare than FSA. Also it is found that a market share of FSA decreases when relative fare of LCC compared to FSA decreases. A market share of FSA increases as flight frequency of FSA increases, as passenger load factor of FSA increases, as passenger load factor of LCC decreases. Entrance of LCC in the air transportation market in Korea is one of factors affecting diversification of demand for travel. The entrance affects putting back of travel demand for oversea toward to domestic travel."}]},"fpage":"275","lpage":"295","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.275","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.009","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865825","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865822","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\ud669 \uc608\uce21\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc9d1\ud569\uc9c0 \ub9e4\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Collective Intelligence Mechanism for Prediction of Shipping Market Conditions"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Collective Intelligence Mechanism for Prediction of Shipping Market Conditions"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ucd94\ubd09\uc131(\uc21c\ucc9c\ud5a5\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacbd\uae30 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc138 \ub454\ud654\uc640 \uc120\ubcf5\u2024\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc758 \uc218\uae09\ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ubd88\ud669\uc774 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. 2003\ub144 \uc774\ud6c4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacbd\uae30\uc640 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ud638\uc870\uc138\uc5d0 \ud798\uc785\uc5b4 2008\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud070 \ud3ed\uc758 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc138\ub97c \uc774\uc5b4\uc624\ub358 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub300\ud615 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc120\ubc15 \ubc1c\uc8fc \uc99d\uac00\uc640 \uc7a5\uae30\uc6a9\uc120 \ud655\ub300\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ub2e8\uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc774 \ud798\ub4e4\ub9cc\ud07c \uc120\ubcf5\ub7c9 \uacfc\uc789\ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub800\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\uae09\ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc740 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \uc120\uc885\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc784 \ud558\ub77d\uc744 \ubd88\ub7ec\uc640 \ubd80\ucc44\ube44\uc728\uacfc \ucc28\uc784\uae08 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \ud574\uc6b4\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc218\uc775\uc131\uc744 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc545\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 \ud0c0 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ud638\ud669\uacfc \ubd88\ud669\uc758 \uc8fc\uae30\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae38\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud574\uc6b4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacf5\uae09\uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc120\ubc15\uc870\ub2ec \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud655\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30 \uc608\uce21\uc774 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uc120\ud589\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc9d1\ud569\uc9c0(collective intelligence)\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc608\uce21\uae30\ubc95\uc758 \uadfc\uac04\uc774 \ub418\ub294 MML(micro-macro loop)\ud615\ud0dc\uc758 \ub9e4\ucee4\ub2c8\uc998\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0, \uba40\ud2f0\uc5d0\uc774\uc804\ud2b8 \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0c1\ud638\ubc18\ubcf5\uc801\uc778 \uc608\uce21\ud615\uc131\uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uace0\ucc30\ud574 \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The study develops a simple mechanism as a collective intelligence based forecasting method to forecast a shipping market conditions and evaluates its performance by multi-agent simulation experiments. The mechanism is described based a prediction market with a micro-macro loop(MML; virtual cycle) and a multi-agent approach which is known as one of the feasible ways to interpret the prediction mechanism as well as social phenomena. Each agent who has a forecasting strategy interacts on each other in the MML which can be thought of as a core concept to collect widely dispersed information or knowledge among economic actors. In the prediction market, through the iterative interactions between other agents or the market, agents revise their forecasting strategies to maximize their expected profits during each period.\\nTo identify a formation process of the collective intelligence in the proposed mechanism, we carried out a multi-agent simulation with four types of agents according to ups and downs of shipping market conditions and in addition to the cycle length. Every 50 simulation steps, we derived dominant forecasting strategy of the agents and expected profit. Meanwhile an agent(1) was the dominant forecasting strategies at t=50, t=100 and t=200, an agent(3) was the dominant forecasting strategy from t=100 to 200. In the simulation, we observed the interactions with the MML for collecting intelligence which was the greatest reward for this study."}]},"fpage":"263","lpage":"274","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.263","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.007","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865822","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865811","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ud574\uc678\uc9c4\ucd9c \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 - \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd\uae30\ubc18 \uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Impact of Internal Resources on Internationalization Choice of Korean Logistics Firms: Focusing on the Resource and Knowledge Based View"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Impact of Internal Resources on Internationalization Choice of Korean Logistics Firms: Focusing on the Resource and Knowledge Based View"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc591\uc601\uc218(\uc5f0\uc138\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc7ac\uc740(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790\uc6d0(\uad6d\ub0b4\uc0ac\uc5c5\uacbd\ud5d8\uc790\uc6d0, \ud574\uc678\uc0ac\uc5c5\uacbd\ud5d8\uc790\uc6d0, \uc7ac\ubb34\uc790\uc6d0, \uae30\uc220\uc790\uc6d0)\uc774 \ud574\uc678\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ucd9c \uc120\ud0dd\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd\uae30\ubc18\uad00\uc810\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud55c\uad6d \uc0c1\uc7a5\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4 \uc911 \uc218\uc0c1 \ubc0f \uc721\uc0c1, \uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c 1980\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2006\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uae30\uac04 \ub3d9\uc548 494\uac1c\uc758 \ud328\ub110\uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ud56d \ub85c\uc9c0\uc2a4\ud2f1 \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ud574\uc678\uc0ac\uc5c5\uacbd\ud5d8\uc790\uc6d0\uacfc, \uc7ac\ubb34\uc790\uc6d0, \uae30\uc220\uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc77c\uc218\ub85d \ud574\uc678\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ucd9c\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \uad6d\ub0b4\uc0ac\uc5c5\uacbd\ud5d8\uc790\uc6d0\uc774 \ud48d\ubd80\ud55c \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc77c\uc218\ub85d \ud574\uc678\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c4\ucd9c\ud558\uae30 \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \ub0b4\uc218\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc548\uc8fc\ud558\ub824\ub294 \uacbd\ud5a5\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ud55c\uad6d \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c\ud654 \uad00\ub828 \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc810\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud560 \ub54c, \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0 \ubc0f \uc9c0\uc2dd\uae30\ubc18 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc790\uc6d0\uacfc \ud574\uc678\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ucd9c\uc120\ud0dd \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0 \uc758\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud574\uc678\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9c4\ucd9c \uc120\ud0dd\uc758 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uc774\ub860\uc801\xb7\uc2e4\ubb34\uc801 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper intends to analyze the determinants of internationalization choice of Korean logistics firms. Specifically, the research examines the effect of internal resources such as, domestic business experience resource, international experience resource, financial resource, and technological resource on internationalization of Korean logistics firms. Domestic business experience resource is measured as the age of the firm in years which represents the firm\'s domestic operating experience. The international experience is measured as the proportion of export sales to the total sales at time t and the ratio of foreign sales to total sales are used as the proxy for the different stage of internationalization of firms. Financial resource is captured by debt to equity ratio and technological resource is measured by measured by research and development (R&D) expenses per employee.\\nBased on resource based view (RBV) and knowledge based view (KVB), we presents four hypotheses. Hypothesis 1a suggests that Korean firm\'s domestic business experience resource is negatively related to the internationalization Choice of Korean Logistics Firms. In contrast, hypothesis 1b anticipates that Korean firm\'s international business experience resource is positively related to the internationalization Choice of Korean Logistics Firms. Hypothesis 2 and hypothesis 3 suggest that both financial resource and technological resource are positively related to the internationalization Choice of Korean Logistics Firms.\\nBased on the sample of port logistics, land logistics, transportation service firms listed on the Korean Stock Exchange (KSE) for the period of 1980-2006, the results revealed that international business experience resource, financial resource, and technological resource is positively related to the internationalization of logistic firms. However, the domestic business experience resource is negatively related to the internationalization choice of logistics firms. This paper investigates the relationship between internal resources and internationalization based on resource and knowledge based view. This study suggests some theoretical and managerial implications for logistic firms of internationalization choices."}]},"fpage":"241","lpage":"261","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.241","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.015","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865811","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865806","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \ub0b4 \uc720\ub2db\ub85c\ub4dc \ubb3c\ub958\uc791\uc5c5\uc758 \uc18c\uc694\uc2dc\uac04\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The simulation study on working time of unit load cargo in warehouse"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The simulation study on working time of unit load cargo in warehouse"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ucd5c\uc138\uacbd(\ub355\ud3c9\ubb3c\ub958)","\uae40\ud658\uc131(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\uc6b0\uc11d(\ub355\ud3c9\ubb3c\ub958)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\ub294 \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \ubcf4\uad00\uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc124\uc758 \ud55c \uc885\ub958\ub85c\uc368 \ubb3c\ub958\ube44\ub97c \uc808\uac10\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc18c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf4\uad00 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc791\uc5c5 \uc18d\ub3c4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\ub2db\ub85c\ub4dc \ubb3c\ub958\uc791\uc5c5\uc740 \ud544\uc218\uac00 \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc804\uccb4 \uc791\uc5c5\uc2dc\uac04\uacfc \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc791\uc5c5\ubcc0\uc218\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc774 \ub530\ub978\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubaa8\ub4c8\ub85c \uc815\uc758\ub418\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uae30\ub465 \uac04\uaca9\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc758 \uc720\ub2db\ub85c\ub4dc \ubb3c\ub958\uc791\uc5c5\uc744 3D \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc2dc\uac01\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc791\uc5c5\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \ubc18\uc601\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \uc720\ub2db\ub85c\ub4dc\ub97c \ucde8\uae09\ud558\ub294 \ubb3c\ub958\uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc0dd\uac01 \ud589\ub3d9(\uacb0\ud569, \uc774\ub3d9, \ub9ac\ud504\ud2b8 \uc5c5/\ub2e4\uc6b4, \ud574\uccb4, \ubcf5\uadc0)\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\ubd84\ud654 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubaa8\ub4c8 \uac1c\ub150\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc804\uccb4 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc791\uc5c5\uc744 \uc124\uba85\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc900\ub2e4.\\n\ubaa8\ub4c8\ud654\ub41c \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \uc791\uc5c5\uc720\ud615\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc804\uccb4\ub85c \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc791\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\ub358 \uc885\uc0ac\uc790 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc2dc\uac01\uacfc \uae30\ucd08\ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud560 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Generally warehouse is considered with one of logistics facilities which have a fright storage function to reduce the logistics cost. Recently, the handling of unit load cargo in warehouse is required to increase storage efficiency and work speed. However, it is difficult to measure total work time and the total work paths in whole warehouse because of frequently change of work environments. From this point of views, this study will analysis the logistics process in logistic center (defined as \u201cmodule\u201d) and also the internal operation of logistics center will be implemented by a 3D simulation method.\\nA result of simulation analysis which are visualized and reflected real working time shows that the unit load handling operation can be divided by the thought behaviors (united, moving, lift up/down, dismantling, returning). And the 3D simulation will explain the logistics process of whole logistics center through the application of the concept of module plan.\\nThe module structure and work pattern of warehouse are expected that workers and researchers to be offered a different point of warehouse view and the base data (it can explain the unit load handing logistics operation in hour). This future application of this research should expect even more advanced studies."}]},"fpage":"219","lpage":"240","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.219","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.006","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865806","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865803","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d - \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc804\ud6c4 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uc804\uc0b0\uc5c5\u2024\uc6b4\uc218\uc5c5\uacfc \ube44\uad50\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A comparative analysis on the business performance between ocean-going shipping companies and other industries"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A comparative analysis on the business performance between ocean-going shipping companies and other industries"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\ud0dc\uc77c(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc774\ub4e4 \uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc601\ub09c\uc744 \uacaa\ub294 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uadfc\uac04\uc774 \ubb34\ub108\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uc6b0\ub824\uac00 \ud33d\ubc30\ud558\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uacbd\uc601\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc804\ud6c4 \uc7ac\ubb34\uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc804\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc218\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uc758 \ud2b9\uc9d5\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc \uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uacbd\uc601\uc774 \ud06c\uac8c \uc545\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\uc804 \uc804\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc218\uc5c5\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub098\uc740 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\uc73c\ub098 \uacbd\uc81c\uc0c1\ud669\uc774 \uc545\ud654\ub41c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\ub294 \ube44\uad50 \uc5c5\uc885\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc545\ud654\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc678\ud56d\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \uacbd\uc81c \uc545\ud654\uc2dc \ub9ac\uc2a4\ud06c \uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\ub300\ud558\uba70, \uacbd\uc81c \ud638\uc804\uc2dc \uae30\ud0c0 \uc5c5\uc885\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uac00 \ud070 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"As the ocean-going shipping companies play a key role in Korea\'s shipping industry, concern that the basis of Korea\'s shipping industry may collapse is prevalent among the shipping markets if they are continuously suffering from financial difficulties. This paper analyzes the business performance of ocean-going shipping companies that have experienced difficulties in management since the global financial crisis. Specifically, the study conducts financial statement analysis of ocean-going shipping companies in Korea, analyzes their financial structure before and after the financial crisis, and compare with business performance of transportation industry and all industries. As a result, this paper finds the characteristics of the business outcome of korea\'s ocean-going shipping companies. Overall, their management condition has deteriorated considerably since the global financial crisis. In the result of comparative analysis, while their business outcomes were better than the transport industry and all industries before the financial crisis, their business outcome is getting significantly worse than the transport industry and all industries after the crisis. Therefore, during the economic boom, business outcomes of ocean-going shipping companies are better than the other industries, whereas during the economic recession, the need for risk management is growing."}]},"fpage":"197","lpage":"218","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.197","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.012","citation-count":"12","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865803","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865802","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \uae30\uc900 \ubb34\uc5ed\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d - \uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Korean Trade in Value Added Focusing on Water Transport Industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Korean Trade in Value Added Focusing on Water Transport Industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ubbfc\uaddc(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc774\uac74\uc6b0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uad6d\uc81c\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \uae30\uc900 \ubb34\uc5ed\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c 2007\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2011\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 WIOD\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ud45c\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\uac00 \ubc0f \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \uae30\uc900 \ubb34\uc5ed\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacbd\uc81c \uc704\uae30\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \ud568\uc758\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc, 2009\ub144 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c GDP\uc758 \ud574\uc678 \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 \ud0c0 \uad6d\uac00\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc804\ub144 \ub300\ube44 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58\uac00 \ud070 \ud3ed\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud588\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ub0b4\uc218 \uacbd\uc81c\uac00 \ud0c0 \uad6d\uac00\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc704\uae30\uc5d0 \ucde8\uc57d\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uac16\ucd98 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ub41c\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \ud574\uc678\uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 99.5%\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uc740 \uc21c\uc218\ucd9c \ubc0f \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \uc21c\uc774\uc785 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\uccb4 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \uac00\uc6b4\ub370 4\uc704\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\ub294 \ub4f1 \uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc5ed\ud560\uc774 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcfc \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubb34\uc5ed \ud328\ud134\uc744 \uc790\uc138\ud558\uac8c \ubd84\uc11d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uc758 \ubc1c\uc804 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \ud070 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc744 \uc904 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\ub300\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper aims to analyze Korean trade in value added using global multi-regional input-output model. For the analyses of the Korean trade in value added between 2007 and 2011, time-series of world input-ouput tables for 40 countries and a model for the rest of the world provided by the World Input Ouput Database (WIOD) are used. We study the comparison of Korean trade in value added before and after the global financial crisis. In particular, we explore policy implications for water transport industry from the analyses. The results show that Korea was more dependent on foreign final demands in 2009 when compared to other countries. This is mainly caused by reducing trade in value added from domestic final demands, not by enhancing Korea\'s export performance and competitiveness. It means that Korea\'s domestic economic structure is more vulnerable under conditions of external uncertainty (i.e., global crisis) than that of other countries. Of all types of industries, water transport industry ranks fourth for its net export and net trade in value added, which implies that water transport industry plays a key role in economic activities.

Third party ship management company has been promoting specialization of shipping industry and providing competitive edge to medium and small ship owners. Therefore, ship management business is expecting to establish basement of qualitative development for shipping by innovation of ship management related technology.\\nJapanese opened its ship management market to foreign company from 1990\u2019s. Korean ship management companies are trying to enter Japanese market because of its size, more than 2,808 vessels of over 2,000G/T, and geographical and cultural proximity.\\nThis paper focused on the development of entry strategies to Japanese ship-management market by Korean Ship management companies. We carried out survey about Japanese ship-management market to experts of ship-management companies in Korea and Japan. Based on this survey, we analyzed choosing factors of ship management companies by fuzzy decision making analysis.\\nExperts of Japanese ship management companies selected factor about providing high quality service of ship management and keeping ship management policies of shipowner is most important, that followed by factors about possibility supply of able seafarers, cost-cut ability, quick response to shipowner\u2019s request and submitting good ship inspection report.\\nBut experts of Korean ship management companies selected factor about quick response to shipowner\u2019s request is most important, that followed by effective cost control, cost-cut ability and total level of ship management fee.\\nTherefore, we suggested following measures for entering Japanese market by Korea ship-management companies.\\nFirstly, Korean ship management companies need to develop high quality service by communicating ship management strategies with Japanese shipowner that base on the relationship marketing. It will be fully equipped by information technology that Korean ship management companies have advantage.\\nSecondly, Korean ship management companies need to develop an own sophisticate seaman supply strategies because that Japanese ship owner give importance to possibility of high quality seaman supply and direct manning system of ship management company. Therefore, Korean companies have to establish its own education system for cultivating SI and seamen in accordance with the Japanese market needs.\\nThirdly, even though Korean ship management industry need to prepare to get economic of scale in management, Korea companies need to give importance specialization of its fleet because importance of managing fleet size is not important factor for choosing ship management service by Japanese ship owner."}]},"fpage":"155","lpage":"172","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.155","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.002","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865798","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865796","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad11\uc591\ud56d \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ubaa8\ub378 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubd81\uadf9\ud56d\ub85c \ud654\ubb3c \uc120\ud0dd\uacfc\uc81c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis on the Business Model for the Gwangyang port In case of development of the Northern Sea Route"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis on the Business Model for the Gwangyang port In case of development of the Northern Sea Route"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc11d(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc120\uad6c(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559)","\uac15\ub300\ub828(\ud638\ub0a8\uc720\ud654)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ubd81\uadf9\ud56d\ub85c \uac1c\ucc99\uc73c\ub85c \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uacfc \ub300\ucc98\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubcf8\uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\ubc29\uc5c5\uc740 \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \ubd81\uadf9\ud56d\ub85c \uac1c\uc124 \uc2dc \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ud654\ubb3c\ud615\ud0dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ub2e4\uae30\uc900 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc774 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ub418\ub294 Fuzzy-AHP\ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\uc758 \uacc4\uce35\uad6c\uc870 \uc911 \ucd5c\uc0c1\uc704 \uacc4\uce35\uc740 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\ud45c\uc778 \uad11\uc591\ud56d \ubd81\uadf9\ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0 \uc801\ud569\ud55c \ud654\ubb3c\ud615\ud0dc\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\uae30\uc900\uc740 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\uc758 \uc758\uacac\uc744 \uc885\ud569\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc775\uc131, \uc548\uc815\uc131, \ub300\uc751\uc131, \uc2dc\uae09\uc131, \uc7a5\ub798\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uc885 \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud654\ubb3c\ud615\ud0dc \ub300\uc548\uc740 \ubc8c\ud06c\ud654\ubb3c, \uc561\uccb4\ud654\ubb3c, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud654\ubb3c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uad11\uc591\ud56d \ubd81\uadf9\ud56d\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\uae30\uc900\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub294 \uc2dc\uae09\uc131 \uae30\uc900\uc774 27.5%\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, \ub300\uc751\uc131\uc774 22.7%, \uc218\uc775\uc131\uc774 20.7%, \uc7a5\ub798\uc131\uc774 15.4%, \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc774 13.8% \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc885\ud569\uac00\uc911\uce58\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \ud654\ubb3c\uc720\ud615 \ub300\uc548\uc758 \uc6b0\uc120\uc21c\uc704\ub294 \ubc8c\ud06c\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\uac00 42.9%\ub85c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud654\ubb3c\uc774 28.7%, \uc561\uccb4\ud654\ubb3c\uc774 28.4% \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uad11\uc591\ub9cc\uad8c \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to present a priority among cargo types in case of establishment of the Northern Sea Route that connects to Gwangyang Port. These days, many countries are trying to develop the Arctic Ocean. The reason is the icebergs of the Northern sea routs have been thawing because of global warming. Under this circumstance, North Pole Route, especially Northern Sea Route (NSR) would become the most notable route which will create several benefits including economic profit. Also, it would be the next generation\'s trade route that connects Europe and Asia. This study analyzed the distance reduction rates of the NSR compared to the Suez routes: which is the major route for transporting the four major energy sources ofKorea: natural gas, oil, coal, and iron ore. This study is focused on collecting data on shipping company, shipper, operational company, government agency, and freight target party and used Fuzzy-AHP in order to analyze the priority. Due to the global warming, polar ice caps at the Arctic Ocean have been melting rapidly. Naturally, therefore, many countries are paying attention to this environmental change. The accurate number varies, but many studies have pointed out that the northern sea route would become a desirable route due to commercial reasons in 20/30 years. These facts indicate that people would be able to use this new route more than hundred days per year in the near future. Hence, not to miss this great opportunity, this paper analyzes the priority on cargos which are assorted by category such as: profitability, stability, correspondence, urgency, and prospective. By analyzing relative importance, correspondenceand urgency ranked at the top by recording 27.43%. Correspondence was 22.7% and profitability was 20.7% and prospective was 15.4%. Stability was 13.8%. A priority on cargo types that assorted by total weight indicates an alternative plan. Bulk cargo ranked at the top (42.9%) and Container cargo(28.7%) came second. Fluid cargo(28.4) was third (27.2%). Consequently, according to this research, the main criterion on Gwangyang port in the case of the northern sea route should be bulk cargo. Although this research has been completed, further study is required. First of all, several details on cargos\' profitability, stability, correspondence, urgency, and prospective are based on the Gwangyang port. Therefore, additional study that focused on the Arctic route will be required such as distance, merits and demerits, and unique qualities. Second, analysis of the components can be modified defend on the purpose of the varied studies. However, this study has limited it for analysis on the business model for the Gwangyang port in case of development of the Northern sea route."}]},"fpage":"135","lpage":"154","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.135","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.001","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865796","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865787","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d\uc758

the North Pole Route. The attraction for Asian and Korean ports in opening up the North Pole route is straightforward - it will shorten the traditional route (Southwest route) between Asia and Europe via the Suez Canal by 10-20 days depending on exactly the locations of the loading and unloading ports. Making such cuts in transport times means major savings in fuel and lower costs for shipping industry. In addition, the new route will avoid the pirate-active waters of the Indian Ocean and the Red Sea, which will save hugely in terms of damage to the property and human lives.\\nFor the above reason, many countries including arctic coastal and Asian nations are trying to open the North Pole Route, thereby avoiding environmental destruction to the area. Korea has been also taking action actively in the development of NSR. As a milestone, Korea has been admitted as an observer to the Arctic Council on May 15, 2013. To benefit from this new position and to gain comparative advantage, Korea is constructing partnership with Russia in such ports development as expanding its facility of existing ports located in East Sea such as Pusan Port, Kwangyang Port and Ulsan Port.\\nAs it is anticipated that the summer sea ice is almost gone in the Arctic Ocean in 2030, Korea must reorganize the international logistics network by using NSR under the scenario of the thawing of the Arctic ice caps. Therefore the purpose of this paper is to contribute to the improvement of NSR by studying the ways to reorganize international logistic route via North Pole Route as well as analyzing the opening of Korean North Pole Route and its economic effects."}]},"fpage":"105","lpage":"134","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.105","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.014","citation-count":"11","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865787","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865786","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\xb7\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An analysis on Efficiency of Car-Ferry Shipping Companies in Korea-China routes"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An analysis on Efficiency of Car-Ferry Shipping Companies in Korea-China routes"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc815\ud604\uc7ac(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\uac74\uc2dd(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c\u2024\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc815\ucc45\uc801\uc778 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ud56d\ub85c\ud604\ud669 \ubd84\uc11d, \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800, \uc790\ub8cc\ud3ec\ub77d\ubd84\uc11d(DEA)\ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec 15\uac1c\uc758 \ud55c\u2024\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \ud56d\ub85c \uc989 \uc758\uc0ac\uacb0\uc815\ub2e8\uc704(DMU: Decision Making Unit)\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud55c\u2024\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud22c\uc785\uc694\uc18c\ub85c\ub294 \u2018\uc120\ubc15 \uc801\uc7ac\ub2a5\ub825\u2019, \u2018\ud56d\ud574\uc2dc\uac04\u2019, \u2018\ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ud56d\ucc28 \uc218\u2019\ub97c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc0b0\ucd9c\uc694\uc18c\ub85c\ub294 \u2018\ucd1d \ud654\ubb3c \uc218\uc1a1\ub7c9\u2019\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

As a research methodology for relative efficiency of CFSRs, DEA-CCR model is applied to 15 routes. To draw out the efficiency of targeted CFSRs, \'ship\'s loading capacity\', \'voyage time\' and \'number of voyage\' are used as input variables while the \'the total transportation volumes\' is represented as output variables. As a result, the CFSRs such as Incheon-Lianyungang, Incheon-Weihai, Incheon-Qingdao, and Pyeongtaek- Rongcheon are the most efficient routes which are scored BCC 1.

In particular, there are four reasons of market failures. First, the private decision-making of shipping company cannot be based on social benefit (e.g., stability of transporting export and import goods). Second, there could be coordination failure. Third, there is externality in establishing the shipping guarantee fund. Fourth, the capital-intensive shipping industry shows high volatile cycle. These market failure cases in financial markets are suggested by Stiglitz(1994), \u201cThe Role of the State in Financial Markets\u201d, Proceedings of the World Bank Annual Conference on Development Economics 1993. That is, it is expected that the shipping guarantee fund will remedy these market failures. Furthermore, through reviewing the other fund cases such as credit guarantee schemes, we could conclude that the establishment of shipping guarantee fund as public unit is valid. Finally, this paper suggests an integrated fund-raising measures which include direct fiscal fund raising, indirect private fund raising by the tax system, and mandatory private fund raising."}]},"fpage":"55","lpage":"80","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2014.30.1.55","uci":"G704-000463.2014.30.1.004","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001865783","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2014","pub-mon":"03","volume":"30","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001865781","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 SCM \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc778\uc774 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Effects of SCM Components of Container Port on Port Performance"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Effects of SCM Components of Container Port on Port Performance"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc120\uad6c(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559)","\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc11d(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc778\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc774 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc744 \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 SCM \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub0b4\ubd80 \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801 \uc911\uc2ec\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc870\uc9c1\ud559\uc2b5, \ud56d\ub9cc\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uc640\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub294 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uc815\ubcf4\uacf5\uc720\uc131, \ub300\uc751\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4 \uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa8\ud615\uacfc \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uace0, \uc124\ubb38\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc124\uc815\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa8\ud615\uacfc \uac00\uc124\uc740 \ub2e4\uc911\ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uac80\uc99d\uacb0\uacfc \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac \uad6c\uc131\uc6d0\uac04\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9 \uad00\uc810\uc758 \ub300\uc751\uc131 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 SCM \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc778 \uc911 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc774 \ud070 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc740 \ub3d9\uc801 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744, \ud56d\ub9cc\ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\ub294 \uc815\uc801 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study was an exploratory research for developed measurement instrument and measuring performance of container port in supply chains.

Reliability and validity were identified by the confirmation of preconditions of multivariate analysis and the hypotheses were tested by cluster analysis, analysis of variance, post hoc analysis and regression analysis. The results are as follows. First, information systems have a positive effect on relationship collaboration in a cluster which has a high level of information systems. This means that relationship collaboration is based on a level of information systems. Second, information systems have a positive effect on performance in a cluster which has a high level of information systems. This means that cost performance and service performance are based on a level of information systems.

The estimates with cointegration methodology proposed by Engle andGranger(1987) are not significant. The linearity has been tested, which is providedby Harvey and Leybourne(2007), and the results show the series are nonlinear. Thuswe employ Gregory and Hansen(1997)-type nonlinear cointegration test that considersstructure changes in intercept and/or trend. The test for the null hypothesis ofcointegration against nonlinear regression model with variables has beenproposed. The null distribution of the test was simulated using Monte Carlosimulation under the random walk assumption and the critical values at 1%, 5%and 10% significant levels are given. In general, the test statistics are more negativethan those for the corresponding standard Dickey-Fuller test. The estimated resultssupport statistically nonlinear long-run equilibrium relationships between variables inboth directions. This implication with nonlinear approach shows better empiricalresults than linear form based analysis and it provides the necessity of consideringeconomic variations to the trade volume forecasts

Research used in the study includes a literature review, return oninvestment analysis, matrix analysis and interviews. The authors used theprogressive performance indicators method, to overcome challenges in the port saleseffectiveness analysis, which was comprised of a qualitative analysis based onquestionnaires and return on investment analysis. The authors further examine theeffectiveness of port sales activities through matrix analysis and interviews. In thefield of customer relationship management, a positive maintenance strategy isidentified as suitable for existing customers and an active attraction strategy isshown as effective for latent customers. In relation to public relations, theparticipation in international events such as exhibitions, conferences, and hosting ofspecial port days or seminars is seen to provide the best opportunity to capture newsales.

Themain reasons for popularity of CMS analysis are its simplicity and applicability toready-to-use published data at a reasonable disaggregation. The competitivenesseffect summarizes the influence of changes in price competitiveness and changes innon-price competitiveness (expresses by qualitative factors reflecting productdifferentiation) on export performance. The competitiveness effect reveals thecapacity of a port to increase its market share due to competitiveness factors only,independently of structural developments in the market or in the product tradepattern. Both Gwangyang and Incheon have a negative value of thecompetitiveness effect, indicating a competitive disadvantage of the two portscompared to China. The two ports also do not take full advantage of the stronglygrowing demand in China and have lost market share in China. Furthermore theexport structure of the Incheon port is much more vulnerable than that ofGwangyang. The two ports have one thing in common; the China\u2019s fast growingimport demand only leads to their export increase."}]},"fpage":"993","lpage":"1008","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.4.993","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.4.004","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001836310","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"10","volume":"29","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001818044","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc131\ud638 \uc774\uc775\uc758 \uc720\ud1b5\u2024\uc0c1\uc5c5\uad00 \uc5f0\uad6c- \u661f\u6e56\u50ff\u8aaa\uacfc \u85ff\u6182\u9304\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"LEE Ik\'s Views on Distribution and Commerce"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"LEE Ik\'s Views on Distribution and Commerce"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc131\uc900(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \u300e\uc131\ud638\uc0ac\uc124\u300f\uacfc \u300e\uacfd\uc6b0\ub85d\u300f\uc5d0 \ud45c\ucd9c\ub41c \uc774\uc775\uc758 \uc720\ud1b5\u2024\uc0c1\uc5c5\uad00\uc744 \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574 \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \uc774\uc775\uc740 \ub2f9\ub300 \ud48d\uc18d\uc774 \ub545\uc5d0 \ub5a8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uace0 \uac00\ub09c\ud558\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801 \uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uc0ac\uce58 \ub54c\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \uc131\ud638\ub294 \uc0b4\uc544\uac00\ub294 \ub370 \uba39\uace0 \uc785\ub294 \uac83(\u8863\u98df)\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\ub294 \uac83(\u4f4f)\uc774 \uadf8 \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0, \uc774\uc640 \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0ac\uce58\ub294 \ucca0\uc800\ud788 \uc5b5\uc81c\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub294 \uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \uc5b5\uc81c\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub3c8\uc744 \uc5c6\uc568 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uc73c\ub098, \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c8\uc744 \uc5c6\uc560\uae30\ub294 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \ub9cc\ud07c \ubc18\uc591\uc804\uc774\ub098 \uc740\ud654 \ub4f1\uc758 \uace0\uc561\ud654\ud3d0\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc218\uc640 \uc601\uc5c5\uc2dc\uac04\uc744 \uc81c\ud55c\ud560 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ucc98\ub7fc \uc131\ud638\ub294 \uc2dc\uc885\uc77c\uad00 \u6291\u672b\u8ad6\u7684 \uc785\uc7a5\uc744 \uacac\uc9c0\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0c1\uc778\uc744 \u56db\u6c11\uc758 \ud558\ub098\ub85c\uc11c \uadf8 \uc874\uc7ac\ub97c \uc778\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubb3c\ud654\uc758 \uc720\ud1b5\uc744 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud558\uac8c \ud558\ub294 \ub370\ub294 \ub9d0, \uc218\ub808, \ubc30 \ub4f1\uc758 \ub300\ud615 \uc720\ud1b5\uc218\ub2e8\uc758 \uc7a5\uc810\uc744 \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ucc98\ub7fc \uc131\ud638\uac00 \uc5b5\ub9d0\ub860\uc801 \uacac\ud574\ub97c \uac00\uc84c\ub358 \uac83\uc740 \uc0ac\uce58\ub97c \ubd80\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uac80\uc57d\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud558\ub294 \uc131\ub9ac\ud559\uc801 \uacbd\uc81c\uad00\uacfc \ub545\uc744 \uc783\uace0 \ud30c\uc0b0\ud558\ub294 \ub18d\ubbfc\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc560\ubbfc\uc815\uc2e0\uc744 \uac00\uc84c\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"YI Ik, whose pen name is Seongho, was a Confucius scholar in the first half ofthe 18th century in Chosun Dynasty.

It is alsofound that most of this inefficiency is due to pure technical inefficiency rather thanscale inefficiency. Especially, despite the differences between the technical efficiencyscores estimated with SFA and DEA, the results from the two methods arestatistically significantly and positively correlated, thus opening the way for bothapproaches to be used together in a complementary manner. It is expected that theresults of this study provide an useful information for government policydevelopment concerning logistics industry in the future."}]},"fpage":"937","lpage":"954","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29..937","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29..008","citation-count":"21","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001818043","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"10","volume":"29","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001818042","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ubbfc\uac04\ubb34\uc7a5\ubcf4\uc548\uc694\uc6d0 \uace0\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c\uad00\ub828 \uc8fc\uccb4\ubcc4 \ub300\uc751 \ubc0f \uad6d\uc81c\ubc95\uc801 \uc7c1\uc810 \uac80\ud1a0"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The responses of the related parties to the employment of PCASP and the examination of international legal issues"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The responses of the related parties to the employment of PCASP and the examination of international legal issues"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ub3d9\ud604(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc790\uc601(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc18c\ub9d0\ub9ac\uc544 \ud574\uc801\ud589\uc704\uac00 \uc870\uc9c1\ud654\u2027\uc9c0\ub2a5\ud654\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc721\uc0c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc838\uc654\ub358 \ubbfc\uac04\ubcf4\uc548\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc774 \ud574\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6d\uc81c\ud574\uc0ac\uae30\uad6c(IMO)\ub294 \ubbfc\uac04\ubb34\uc7a5\ubcf4\uc548\uc694\uc6d0(PCASP)\uc758 \uace0\uc6a9\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub4e4\uc758 \uc2b9\uc120\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc900 \ubc0f \uad8c\uace0\ub97c \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uace0 \ud68c\uc6d0\uad6d\uc5d0 \ud68c\ub78c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c PCASP\uc758 \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \ud0d1\uc2b9 \ubc0f \uc774\ub3d9\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uad6d \uc815\ubd80\ub97c \uc0c1\ub300\ub85c \uad00\ub828 \uc815\ucc45 \ubc0f \uc808\ucc28\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \uad8c\uace0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud604\uc7ac \uac01 \uad6d\uac00\uc758 \uad6d\ub0b4\ubc95\ub4e4\uc740 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ucd1d\uae30\ub958 \ud0d1\uc7ac\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uae08\uc9c0, \ud5c8\uc6a9 \ub610\ub294 \uaddc\uc815 \ubbf8\ube44 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud615\ud0dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 2009\ub144 \ud6c4\ubc18\ubd80\ud130 \ub4f1\uc7a5\ud55c PCASP\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uad6d\uc81c\ubc95\uc801 \ub17c\ub780\uc774 \uc77c\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc8fc\uc694 \ub17c\ub780\uc740 PCASP\uc758 \uc9c0\uc704, \uc77c\ubc18\uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ubb34\uc7a5, \ubb34\ub825\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ubc94\uc704, \ubb34\ub825\uc0ac\uc6a9\uc758 \uacb0\uc815\uad8c\ud55c, \uc704\ubc95\ud589\uc704 \uc2dc \uad6d\uac00\ucc45\uc784 \uadc0\uc18d\uc131 \ub4f1\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774 \uac19\uc740 \ub17c\ub780\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ucd5c\uadfc \ubbf8\uad6d, \uc601\uad6d, \ub3c5\uc77c \ub4f1 \uc8fc\uc694 \uad6d\uac00\uac00 PCASP \uc2b9\uc120\uc744 \ud5c8\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\ub3c4 PCASP\uc758 \uace0\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc95\uc81c\ud654\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"As Somali piracy is getting more organized and intelligent, the business of privatesecurity company which is mainly run in the land is recently expanding to theoffshore.

For example, the productioninducing effects and value-added inducing effects of water transport industry inKorea are the twenty sixth and twenty eighth, respectively. So, some policy measuresto increase the economic impacts of water transport industry are necessarily required.\\nIn other words, we propose three important policy strategies such as the promotionof coastal water transportation, the switch from CIF to FOB in the trade terms ofimportant large-volume import cargoes and the promotion of port-related serviceindustries.

Therefore, this study aims to analyze how the economicintegration and FTA influence the maritime trade by applying gravity model.\\nMaritime traffic volumes, particularly container traffic volumes, which account formore than 90% of the total exports and imports in Korea were utilized for thisstudy. The results demonstrated that the maritime trade patterns of container trafficvolumes highly depend on the market size. The economic integration of ASEAN+3was shown to have a trade creation effect, while the EU had a trade diversioneffect. However, FTA was found to have no impact at all. Regarding the effect ofthe distance variable, the estimated coefficient was revealed to decrease in 2011compared to 2004. This may be attributed to the several factors including theincrease in container ship size, the automation of ports and the development of thecargo handling system."}]},"fpage":"765","lpage":"782","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29..765","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29..009","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001818036","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"10","volume":"29","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001818035","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"IPA\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\uc778\ud56d \uc218\uc694\uc790 \ub2c8\uc988\ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Kyoungin Port\'s customers\' needs analysis using Importance-Performance Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Kyoungin Port\'s customers\' needs analysis using Importance-Performance Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ud0dc\ud718(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\uac74\uc2dd(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc815\ud604\uc7ac(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"2012\ub144 \uac1c\uc7a5\ud55c \uacbd\uc778\ud56d\uc740 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c 29\ubc88\uc9f8 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud56d\uc774\ub2e4. \uc2e0\uc0dd\ud56d\ub9cc\uc778 \uacbd\uc778\ud56d\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uc815\ubd80\ub294 \uc120\ubc15 \ubc0f \ud654\ubb3c \uc785\xb7\ucd9c\ud56d\ub8cc, \uc815\ubc15\ub8cc \uac10\uba74 \ub4f1\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc744 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 2012\ub144 12\uc6d4\ub9d0 \uae30\uc900 \ud654\ubb3c\uc120 \uc6b4\ud56d 31\ucc99 267\ud56d\ucc28, \ucc98\ub9ac\ubb3c\ub7c9 26.4\ub9cc\ud1a4\uc5d0 \uadf8\uce58\ub294 \uc800\uc870\ud55c \uc2e4\uc801\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0c8\ub2e4. \uc120\ud589\uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc\uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \uc218\uc694\ubd84\uc11d \ubc0f \ud56d\ub9cc\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654 \ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc2e0\uc0dd\ud56d\ub9cc \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\xb7\ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uc0dd\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \uc218\uc694(Needs)\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ub2e4\uc74c\uacfc \uac19\ub2e4. \uccab\uc9f8, \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c\uc640 \uc2dc\uc124 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uae30\ud56d\ube48\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ub2e4\uc591\uc131\uc744 \ud655\ubcf4\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc785\u2024\ucd9c\ud56d\uc758 \ud3b8\ub9ac\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9ce\uc740 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ube44\uc6a9 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud558\uc5ed\ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ud0c0 \ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ub2e4\uac01\uc801\uc778 \uac80\ud1a0\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uc14b\uc9f8, \ubc30\ud6c4\uc9c0 \ubc0f \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud604\uc2e4\uc801\uc778 \ubc30\ud6c4\uc9c0 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\ubaa8\uc0c9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uacbd\uc778\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6f9\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\ub85c \uacbd\uc778\ud56d \uc774\uc6a9\uc790 \ubc0f \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\uc758 \uc815\ubcf4 \uc778\uc2dd\uc774 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc800\uc870\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \uc774\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ubc29\uc548 \ubaa8\uc0c9\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Kyoungin Port is designated as the 29th trade port in South Korea. Forvitalization of this newly made seaport, the Korean government has carried forwardvarious policies such as the port charge reductions on the entering and departingships as well as ships that are in anchorage. Yet, despite of these policies, thehandling cargo volumes are marked very low as of 264,000 tons using 267 voyages of31 ships. By reviewing through the relating literatures, it has been found that thereis a scant of research to examine the vitalization policies of newly made seaport,such as the needs analysis of the port customers, and the reinforcement of portcompetitiveness. In this respect, the aim of this study is to evaluate the needs of theport customers for Kyoungin Port using Importance-Performance Analysis. Theresults of this research are as follows: firstly, in terms of port network and facilities,there needs to be increased frequency of port calling, and secured diverse-sea routes,thus more efforts are needed to increase the convenience of entrance and departure ofthe port. Secondly, the loading and unloading charge of Kyoungin Port are relativelyhigh compared to the adjacent ports. Further analyses are requested to cut down thehigh costs. Thirdly, as for the hinterland vitalization of Kyoungin Port, practicalresearches are needed. Lastly, in terms of marketing perspective, there are no properweb services for the port customers and related stakeholders."}]},"fpage":"741","lpage":"763","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29..741","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29..004","citation-count":"13","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001818035","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"10","volume":"29","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001818033","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uad50 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Study on development of Coastal Shipping between Korea and Japan"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Study on development of Coastal Shipping between Korea and Japan"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc548\uc6b0\ucca0(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uad6d\uac00\ubb3c\ub958\uccb4\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud0c0 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc218\ub2e8 \ubabb\uc9c0\uc54a\uac8c \uc5f0\uc548\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc758 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \uc5ed\ud560\uc740 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uad6d\uac00\ubb3c\ub958\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\ud654\uc640 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uacfc \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uccb4\uacc4 \uad6c\ucd95\uacfc \uc2e4\ud604\uc5d0\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uc5b4\uc654\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \uc9c0\ub09c 10\ub144\uac04 \uc815\ubd80\uc640 \ud559\uacc4, \uc5c5\uacc4\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc29\uc548\ub4e4\uc774 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uace0 \uc2e4\ud589\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uc740 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc624\ud788\ub824 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc790\uc758 \uc774\ud0c8, \uae30\uc874 \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ud3d0\uc1c4 \ub4f1 \uc5ec\uc804\ud788 \uc545\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud604 \uc2dc\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud68d\uae30\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc548\uc774 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uac70\ub098 \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \uba85\ud655\ud55c \uc758\uc9c0\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \ud55c \ub354 \uc774\uc0c1\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc29\uc548 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub294 \ud070 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4.\\n\uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc744 \uacaa\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uc544\uc774\ub514\uc5b4\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uace0 \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc \ube44\uad50 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub41c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc815\ucc45\ub4e4\uc758 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ubb38\uc81c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc0dd\uac01\ud558\uace0 \uad6d\uac00\ubb3c\ub958\uccb4\uacc4\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uce5c\ud658\uacbd \ub179\uc0c9\ubb3c\ub958\uccb4\uacc4 \uad6c\ucd95\uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uacfc\uc5f0 \uc815\ubd80\uac00 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uc2e4\ucc9c\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The coastal shipping play an important role in Korean Logistics System as muchas other transport modes.

The forecast errorvariance decomposition shows that cargo volumes have a great impact on regionaleconomies in Busan, Incheon, and Gangwon, while the economies like Kyunggi,Gyungnam, and Gyungbuk are not almost affected by their cargo volumes. Thecargo volumes of Jeonnam and Jeonbuk have only a weak effect on the theireconomies.

First, we employ a novel method for classifying bunker price changes as supply and demand shock. Second, based on simple regression we test the effect caused by bunker price change, supply and demand shock to the equity return. Finally, we employ impulse-response analysis to examine regression results. Demand shock shows stable movement around the equilibrium level while supply shock differently moves before and after the financial crisis in 2008. With the contemporaneous framework both demand and supply shocks are significantly correlated with equity returns, which is inconsistent with previous study. Thus we have tested impulse-response analysis and found there are little effect from the both shocks."}]},"fpage":"609","lpage":"626","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.3.609","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.3.010","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001806995","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"09","volume":"29","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001806986","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uacac \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Productivity Analysis of Logistics Provider Service of Middle Standing on Korea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Productivity Analysis of Logistics Provider Service of Middle Standing on Korea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\ud64d\uade0(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd94\ubd09\uc131(\uc21c\ucc9c\ud5a5\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ucc45\uc740 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc640 \ubc94\uc704\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \ub300\ud615\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5 \uc815\ucc45\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uacac\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ub3d9\ubc18 \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\ub294 \ub3d9\uae30\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4.

This study was applying the DEA, Window analysis, Malmquist model. The sixteen regional government logistics service industry that had been observed during 2007 to 2011were chosen as samples of the DMU. Current logistics policy is only focused on total logistics providers. However, in the future, the policy should move on to a new policy that also embraces small and Middle Standing sized enterprises. These days, the importance of international logistics is growing. Therefore, restructuring logistics service industries is inevitable. Logistics providers are already being globalized whether they are small & Middle Standing or big logistics providers. Naturally, being globalized is a very crucial factor when it comes to on competition. Global logistics market is made of two major factors. One is total logistics providers and the other is small and middle sized logistics providers. Logistics industries can be described as a form of consortium and individuals are specialized in their specific filed. The research on efficiency and productivity of Middle Standing logistics providers is required. This paper used DEA/WINDOW, Malmquist analysis in order to verify stability and productivity. According to WINDOW analysis, Chenkyong ranked at the top by scoring 0.008 and it was the most stable company. According to Malmquist analysis, productivity of all the providers was decreased from 1.196 (2007-2008) to 0.904 (2008-2009). from 2009-2010, it was recovered, but during 2010-2011, it slightly decreased. According to management efficiency research, Jongkum Shipping ranked at the top and the others are as following: Hanink Express, Hankook pallet pull, Chenkyong, Sunjin shipping Air, Donggin. According to Frontier analysis, Hankook logistics pull, scored under 1 point, so the company\'s technical progress was inadequate."}]},"fpage":"589","lpage":"608","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.3.589","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.3.007","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001806986","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"09","volume":"29","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001806983","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uad6d\uc81c\uae08\uc735 \ubcc0\uc218, \uc911\uad6d\ud6a8\uacfc, \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30\uc758 \ub3d9\ud0dc\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uc131"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Dynamic Causality among International Financial Variables, China Effect, and Shipping Business Cycle after the Global Financial Crisis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Dynamic Causality among International Financial Variables, China Effect, and Shipping Business Cycle after the Global Financial Crisis"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\ucc3d\ubc94(\uc870\uc120\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2008\ub144 9\uc6d4 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uae30\uac04\uc744 \uc804\ud6c4\ub85c \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\ubcc0\uc218\uc778 BDI(Baltic Dry Freight Index), \uad6d\uc81c\uae08\uc735 \ubcc0\uc218, \uc911\uad6d\ud6a8\uacfc \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \ub3d9\ud0dc\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2dc\uc791\ud558\uae30 \uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \uba3c\uc800 \ub2e8\uc704\uadfc \uac80\uc815\uacfc \uacf5\uc801\ubd84 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubcc0\uc218\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uad00\uacc4 \uc874\uc7ac \uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc 1\ucc28\ucc28\ubd84\ud55c \uc2dc\uacc4\uc5f4\uc790\ub8cc\ub294 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud655\uc778\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ubd84\uc218\ucc28\ubd84\uc758 GPH(Geweke, and Porter-Hudak) \uac80\uc815\uacfc \uc815\uc218\ucc28\ubd84\uc758 Johansen \ub2e4\ubcc0\ub7c9 \uacf5\uc801\ubd84 \uac80\uc815\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uade0\ud615\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc74c\uc73c\ub85c \ubca1\ud130\uc624\ucc28\uc218\uc815\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ub3d9\ud0dc\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \uc804\uccb4\uae30\uac04\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5d4/\ub2ec\ub7ec \ud658\uc728\uacfc BDI, \ubbf8\uad6d\uc8fc\uac00\uc640 BDI \uac04 \uc30d\ubc29\uc801 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud588\uc73c\uba70, \uc704\uae30\uc774\ud6c4\uc5d0 \uc5d4/\ub2ec\ub7ec \ud658\uc728\uacfc \ubbf8\uad6d\uc8fc\uac00\uc758 BDI\uc5d0\uc758 \uc120\ud589\uc131\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c4 \uac83\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uc608\uce21\uc624\ucc28\uc758 \ubd84\uc0b0\ubd84\ud574\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc720\uac00, \ud658\uc728, \uc8fc\uac00, \uc911\uad6d\uc218\uc785\uc774 BDI\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ub2f9\ud55c \ud06c\uae30\ub85c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0 \uc704\uae30\uc774\uc804\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc704\uae30\uc774\ud6c4\uc5d0 \uc720\uac00, \uc911\uad6d\uc218\uc785, \ubbf8\uad6d\uc8fc\uac00\uc758 \uc124\uba85\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study attempts to examine empirically dynamic causal relationships among BDI (Baltic Dry Freight Index), Dubai crude oil price, Chinese imports by value, USD/JPY exchange rate, and Dow Jones industrial average index using the time series data for the period 2000-2012.

The test results indicate that there exist three long-run relationship among the variables. If cointegration is confirmed, there must be unidirectional or bidirectional causality among the series.

According to the coefficient on the lagged error-correction term, there exist three long-run relationship among the variables and the error-correction term is statistically significant. The VECM results reveal there are two meaningful bidirectional relationships. The result states that Granger causality between BDI and Dow Jones stock price runs in both directions. In addition, USD/JPY exchange rates and Dow Jones stock price have unidirectional effects on BDI after global financial crisis. Also, the variance decomposition results show that the explanatory power of petroleum price, Chinese imports, Dow Jones stock price more increased after global financial crisis than before."}]},"fpage":"575","lpage":"589","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.3.575","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.3.002","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001806983","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"09","volume":"29","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001806957","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"SCM \uad00\uc810\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc131\uacfc\uce21\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Measuring Performance of Port Hinterlands in SCM\'s Perspective"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Measuring Performance of Port Hinterlands in SCM\'s Perspective"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc120\uad6c(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\uc6a9\uc11d(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 SCM(Supply Chain Management) \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc640 \uc785\uc8fc\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub85c \ud1b5\ud569\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c SCM \uad00\uc810\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\uc694\uc778\ub4e4\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uace0 \uadf8 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

Maritime industry is also closely associated with globalization. Together with globalization, faster, more reliable, and cheaper maritime transport services have facilitated the expansion of global trade. With the development of emerging economies, the maritime industry had increased dramatically. The rise of China as the world manufacturing center was a key driver of this growth. Since 2008, however, there have been some declines because of the global financial crisis. It is not easy for container ports to have a sufficient container cargo volumes including transshipment. Therefore, container ports in individual countries require effective strategies for generating sufficient container traffic.

In this respect, the aim of this research is to analyze effective management strategies on port\'s LC. As research methodology, the in-depth interviews were proceeded with experts who work in Busan Port Authority(BPA), Incheon Port Authority(IPA), and the Korea Maritime and Port Administration. In this procedure, several LC\'s drawbacks were obtained. The improvement strategies were suggested based on cross-check results which came from analyzing the inspection reports of Ministry of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs, and supreme court judgments. The research results are as follows: firstly, for efficient lease facilities\' management, it is needed to decide the principal agent regarding maintaining and repairing the facilities, and furthermore it is necessary to take an insurance policy.

This paper employs the Granger test and detects the direction of causality, i.e., cause and effect relationship between two variables. Specifically this study shows whether industrial production causes trading volume or trading volume causes industrial production, or is there feedback between the two. We find that there is feedback, or bilateral causality in Incheon, Jeju, and Jeonnam since the sets of industrial production and trading volume coefficients are statistically significantly different from zero in both regressions. This article also shows that trading volume does not Granger-cause industrial production, but industrial production Granger-causes trading volume in Jeonbuk, Busan, Gannwon, Incheon, Jeju, Ulsan and Jeonnam. The response of trading volume to the industrial production impulse is the highest in Jeju but there are great differences among the regions."}]},"fpage":"221","lpage":"235","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.2.221","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.2.007","citation-count":"10","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001784009","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"06","volume":"29","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001784002","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud3ec\ud56d \uad6d\uc81c\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud130\ubbf8\ub110(PICT)\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Estimation on the Productivity of PICT"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Estimation on the Productivity of PICT"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud558\uc601\uc11d(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc11c\uc815\uc218(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc815\uadfc\uc874(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uac1c\uc7a5 \ucd08\uae30\uc5d0 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\ud655\ubcf4\uc758 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6c0\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\uc11d \ub2f9 1\uae30\uc758 CC\ub97c \uc7a5\uce58\ud558\uace0 2\uc120\uc11d\uc73c\ub85c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc2dc\uc791\ud55c PICT\ub294 \uac1c\uc7a5\ud55c\uc9c0 3\ub144 4\uac1c\uc6d4 \ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc57d 15\ub9cc TEU\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uc5ec \ud658\ub3d9\ud574\uad8c \uc911\uc2ec\ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.

The estimation results show that the annual maximum container handling capacity for PICT varied between 146,292 TEU and 154344 TEU, depending upon the value of intervention coefficient of 0.8 and 0.9.

The causality test implies that the increase of trade amounts promoted the growth of container throughput and port facility in Busan, and the growing tonnage of Korean flagged vessels following the Shipbuilding Activation Policy of Korean government helped partially Busan port to catch foreign transshipment cargoes."}]},"fpage":"53","lpage":"81","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.1.53","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.1.002","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001755565","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2013","pub-mon":"03","volume":"29","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001755564","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub178\ub825\uc774 \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5 - \uc9c1\uc6d0\uad8c\ud55c\uc758 \uc870\uc808\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Effects of Service Recovery Effort on Customer Satisfaction in Logistics Firms -Focused on the Moderating Effect of Employee Empowerment-"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Effects of Service Recovery Effort on Customer Satisfaction in Logistics Firms -Focused on the Moderating Effect of Employee Empowerment-"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ucd5c\uc601\ub85c(\uac00\uc57c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub178\ub825\uc774 \uace0\uac1d\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0, \uc774 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c1\uc6d0\uad8c\ud55c\uc758 \uc870\uc808\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc5ec \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa8\ud615\uacfc \uac00\uc124\uc744 \uc124\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00\uc124\uac80\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc11c\uc6b8\uacfc \uacbd\uae30 \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubd80\uc0b0\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5 \uc9c1\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc218\uc9d1\ub41c \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c SPSSWIN ver. 18.0 \ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc870\uc808\ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc2e4\ud328\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud588\uc744 \ub54c \ubb38\uc81c\ud574\uacb0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uac1d\uc758 \ub9cc\uc871\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubb38\uc81c\ud574\uacb0\uacfc\uc815\uacfc \ucc98\ub9ac\uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \uacf5\uc815\ud574\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub178\ub825\uc774 \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uae30\uc5c5 \uc9c1\uc6d0\uc758 \uad8c\ud55c\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub2ec\ub77c\uc9c8 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc\uac00 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study tries to investigate a strategy on the service recovery of logistics company, analyzing the effect of logistics service failure on satisfaction of customer service recovery and the moderating effect of employee empowerment.

Most of previous studies, however, have focused on cost minimization or profit maximization for operating decisions for shipping companies. Traditional performance metrics such as cost minimization have limitations in that they do not consider critical factors like future growth and risk for value maximization. Advanced metrics such as Net present value or Real option can not be considered as an integrated model of operating and investment decision-making model and do not reflect the fact that modern corporations have limited capital and resources. This paper develops an integrated model that links investment and operating decisions for maximizing EVA (economic value added) during a planning horizon. Our model also considers a shipping company which operates multi-divisions such as a container and a bulk division. The proposed model determines the optimal capacity of vessels to meet customer\u2019s demand and provides the optimal number of vessels that involves investment strategies like selling, buying, renting and leasing under the financial constraints."}]},"fpage":"5","lpage":"28","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2013.29.1.5","uci":"G704-000463.2013.29.1.003","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001755563","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"12","volume":"28","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001727095","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\u8336\u5c71 \uc815\uc57d\uc6a9\uc758 \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958 \xb7 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uad00 \uc5f0\uad6c - \u300e\u7d93\u4e16\u907a\u8868\u300f\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Dasan JEONG Yak-yong\'s Views on Commerce and Distri-Logistics"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Dasan JEONG Yak-yong\'s Views on Commerce and Distri-Logistics"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc131\uc900(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc815\uc57d\uc6a9\uc740 \uc870\uc120 \ud6c4\uae30\uc758 \uc2e4\ud559\uc758 \uc9d1\ub300\uc131\uc790\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub294 \u300e\uacbd\uc138\uc720\ud45c\u300f\uc5d0\uc11c \ud589\uc815\uac1c\ud601, \uc9c0\ubc29\ud589\uc815\uc870\uc9c1 \uac1c\ud3b8, \u7530\u5236 \uac1c\ud601, \uc870\uc138 \uac1c\ud601\uc548, \uacfc\uac70 \uac1c\ud601\uc548 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc124\ud30c\ud558\uba74\uc11c \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958 \xb7 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc790\uc2e0\uc758 \uacac\ud574\ub97c \ud53c\ub825\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \u300e\uacbd\uc138\uc720\ud45c\u300f\uc5d0 \ud45c\ucd9c\ub41c\ub2e4\uc0b0 \uc815\uc57d\uc6a9\uc758 \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958 \xb7 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uad00\uc744 \uc815\ub9ac\ud574 \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc0b0\uc740 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uacfc \uc774\uc724 \ucde8\ub4dd, \uc7ac\ubb3c\ucd95\uc801 \ub4f1\uc744 \uae0d\uc815\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc6d0\ud65c\ud55c \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958\uc640 \uc0c1\uc5c5 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc218\ub808\uc640 \ub3c4\ub85c\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654,\uc120\ubc15\uc758 \ud45c\uc900 \ub4f1\uae09\uc81c \ub3c4\uc785\uacfc \uc120\ubc15 \uac74\uc870\uc790 \uc2e4\uba85\uc81c \uc2e4\uc2dc, \uad00\uc601 \u8239\u5ee0\uc758 \uc124\uce58, \ud654\ud3d0 \u6539\u9444\ubc0f \uace0\uc561\uad8c \ubc1c\ud589, \ucc3d\uace0\uc758 \uac1c\uc120, \ub3c4\ub7c9\ud615 \ud1b5\uc77c, \uc804\ubb38 \uad00\uc544\ub85c \uc804\uada4\uc0ac \xb7 \uc804\ud568\uc0ac \xb7 \uc870\uc6b4\uc0ac \xb7 \uc804\ud658\uc11c\xb7 \uc591\ud615\uc0ac \uc124\uce58 \ub4f1\uc744 \uc8fc\ucc3d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\uc9c0\ud568\uacfc \ubc15\uc81c\uac00 \ub4f1\ub3c4 \uc0c1\uc5c5\uacfc \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958, \ud574\uc678\ud1b5\uc0c1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uac15\uc870\ud55c \ubc14 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub2e4\uc0b0\uc740 \ub18d\uc5c5\uc774\ub098 \uc0c1\uc5c5 \uc5b4\ub290 \ud55c \ud3b8\uc5d0 \uce58\uc6b0\uce58\uc9c0\uc54a\uace0 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc774\uace0 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uae4a\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958 \xb7 \uc0c1\uc5c5\ub860\uc744 \uac1c\uc9c4\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \ub370 \uadf8 \uc0ac\uc0c1\uc0ac\uc801 \uc758\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Dasan JEONG Yak-yong** was a Confucius scholar in the late Chosun Dynasty. In this paper, the author made an attempt to extract Dasan\'s views on commerce and distri-logistics by analyzing his GyeongSeYuPyo(A Memorabilia for the Reformation of National System) which mainly aimed for reforming the national system. Dasan regarded the commercial activities, the profit gaining and the accumulation of wealth as the positive things, and asserted to standardize carts, roads and ships as the means of logistics and transportation. He also insisted on establishing public shipyards, issuing gold and silver coins, reforming the warehousing system, and unifying the weights and measures for promoting commercial and distri-logistics activities. Furthermore, Dasan proposed the establishment of the specialized governmental bodies such as bureau of cart, bureau of shipping, bureau of mints, and bureau of the measures and weights for managing and supervising the administration on cart, shipping, money and the measures and weights respectively. LEE Ji-ham and PAK Je-gha placed emphasis on commerce, distribution and overseas trade. However, Dasan had no inclination to one of the physiocracy or mercantilism, and stated more in-depth, comprehensive and systematic views on commerce and distri-logistics than anyone else in Korean history."}]},"fpage":"683","lpage":"707","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.4.683","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.4.003","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001727095","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"12","volume":"28","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001727094","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\uc81c\ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ubc95\ub960\uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Legal Relation of the Contract of International Carriage of Goods by Air"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Legal Relation of the Contract of International Carriage of Goods by Air"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc774\uc81c\ud604(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc218\ud558\uc778\uc6a9 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc6a9 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc7a5\uacfc \ud654\ubb3c\uc740 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \uc778\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \ud654\ubb3c\uc740 \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc758 \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uadf8\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \uc778\ub3c4\ud558\ub77c\uace0 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0 \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc6b4\uc1a1\ucde8\uae09\uc778\uc740 \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc6a9 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc7a5\uacfc \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uadf8\uc758 \ub300\ub9ac\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \uc778\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc6b4\uc1a1\ucde8\uae09\uc778\uc774 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uba85\uc2dc\ub41c \ub0b4\uc6a9\uc744 \uc5b4\uae30\uace0 \ud1b5\uc9c0\ucc98\uc778 \uc218\uc785\uc0c1\uc5d0\uac8c \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc6a9 \ud56d\uacf5\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc7a5\uc744 \uc778\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uc218\uc785\uc0c1\uc774 \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc778 \uc2e0\uc6a9\uc7a5\uac1c\uc124\uc740\ud589\uc5d0\uac8c \uc218\uc785\ub300\uae08\uc744 \uc9c0\uae09\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \ubcf4\uc138\ucc3d\uace0\uc5c5\uc790\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \ubd88\ubc95\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubc18\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec\uac04 \uc0ac\uc548\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uc11c\uc6b8\ubc95\uc6d0 \uc11c\ubd80\uc9c0\uc6d0\uc740 \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc6b4\uc1a1\ucde8\uae09\uc778\uc758 \ubd88\ubc95\ud589\uc704 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubd80\uc778\ud558\uc600\uace0 \ubbf8\uad6d\uc9c0\ubc29\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc774\ub098 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc6b4\uc1a1\ucde8\uae09\uc778\uc758 \ubd88\ubc95\ud589\uc704 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc778\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uad6d\uc9c0\ubc29\ubc95\uc6d0\uc758 \ud310\uacb0\uc774 \uc815\ub2f9\ud558\ub2e4\uace0 \uc0dd\uac01\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc758 \uc218\uc785\ud654\ubb3c\uc778\ub3c4\uc9c0\uc2dc\uc11c\ub97c \ubc1b\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc218\uc785\uc0c1\uc5d0\uac8c \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \ubc18\ucd9c\ud558\uc5ec \uc8fc\uba74 \ubcf4\uc138\ucc3d\uace0\uc5c5\uc790\ub294 \ubd88\ubc95\ud589\uc704 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc838\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc758 \ud310\uacb0\uc740 \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"If the airwaybill provides that on arrival the goods at the place of destination, subject to the acceptance of other instructions from the consignor prior to arrival of the goods at the place of destination, delivery will be made to or in accordance with the instructions of the consignee.\\nIf the carrier or his forwarder handed over to notify party the airwaybill, he did not pay for the goods and carried out the goods from the bonded warehouse by the airwaybill.

The research attempts to classify the types of using logistics. The purpose of this research is to analyze which factors have an effect on the classification.\\nThe results analysis shows that export firms, having a clear goal of the logistics usage, have achieved a better export performance than exporting have not. And the differentiation exerted statistically significant positive influence on the export performance. Then upon looking at the factors of logistics firms, resource level was statistically significant on export performance. Lastly, the ability to export(international) logistics had positive effects on export performance.\\nThis paper finds that logistics firm\u2019s competence is important and is positively associated with export performance.

To evaluate the sustainability of port-city, this paper adopted the Multidimensional Scaling Analysis (MSA) and used eight indicators (population, urban area, GRDP, labor productivity, GRDP per sulfur dioxide emissions, container throughput, the number of direct calling). The selected targeted cities are 13 Asian port-cities that reveal same growth patterns according to the Containerisation International YearBook (2010). The MSA and the MRA are adapted as research methodology using 13 port-cities as dependent variables and 8 attributes as independent variables. As a result, Group B (Nagoya, Hong Kong, Singapore) has been analyzed as the most sustainable port cities while Group A (Tianjin, Qingdao, Shanghai, Dailian) is analyzed as the group with least sustainable port cities.

Among various areas of port logistics industry, transshipment has played an important role. Transshipment is closely related to many activities of the port logistics industry. Port logistics cost is one of them. This study is designed to investigate the relationship between port logistics cost and transshipment in terms of empirical and theoretical perspectives. Also, this study provides various determinants of port logistics cost based on the Transaction Cost Analysis(TCA). The TCA is a theoretical foundation of this study. According to the TCA, asset specificity and uncertainty can be important variables to decrease port logistics cost and increase transshipment. In specific, port infrastructure and port management can be included in asset specificity of container ports. Also, regulatory institution and labor market uncertainty may represent uncertainty of the ports."}]},"fpage":"537","lpage":"557","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.4.537","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.4.007","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001727075","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"12","volume":"28","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001727069","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \ud574\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d - DEA\uc640 Malmquist \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc9c0\uc218 \ud65c\uc6a9 -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Analysis of Productivity Growth in the Shipping Industry Using Malmquist Productivity Index"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Analysis of Productivity Growth in the Shipping Industry Using Malmquist Productivity Index"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\uad11\uc11c(\uc804\uc8fc\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uad6c\uc885\uc21c(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ud669\uacbd\uc5f0(\ucda9\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 DEA\uc640 Malmquist \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc9c0\uc218\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uadfc 6\ub144(2006\ub144~2011\ub144)\uac04 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uc815\ud0dc\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \ub3d9\ud0dc\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\ub300\uc0c1 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub294 2011\ub144 \uae30\uc900 \uc120\ubcf5\ub7c9(TEU) \uc0c1\uc704 20\ub300 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac \uc911 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \uc81c\uc678\ud558\uace0 \uc790\ub8cc\ud68d\ub4dd\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c 11\uac1c \ud574\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 2011\ub144 \uae30\uc900 \uc120\ubcf5\ub7c9 \uc0c1\uc704 100\ub300 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub41c 7\uac1c\uc758 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc774\ub2e4. 2006\ub144\ubd80\ud130 20011\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0 \ud574\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac(\uc77c\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac \ud3ec\ud568)\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc774 \ub9e4\ub144 4.1% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uace0, \ud2b9\ud788 \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub9cc\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 0.6%\ub85c \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc740 \ub9e4\ub144 2.9% \ud558\ub77d\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud574\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 2008\ub144 \ub300\ube44 2009\ub144 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ud3ed \uac10\uc18c\ud55c \ubc18\uba74, \ud55c\uad6d\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\ub294 2009\ub144 \ub300\ube44 2010\ub144 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131\uc774 \ub300\ud3ed \uac10\uc18c\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud558\ub77d\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ucc28\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uad6d\ub0b4\uc678 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud574\uc6b4\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud558\ub77d\uc740 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\ubcc0\ud654 \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uc8fc\ub85c \uae30\uc220\ubcc0\ud654\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper estimates total productivity changes and decomposes them into technical efficiency changes and technological changes for a shipping companies over the period 2006-2011 using data envelopment analysis (DEA).

This insurance system is expected to cover the risk of fluctuating freight rate in the shipping liner market. That is, when the actual freight index of the current shipping liner market decreases below the expected freight index fixed in a contract of insurance, the insurer will compensate for the freight loss, whereas the insurer will withdraw the difference from the insured (shipping companies) when the actual freight index of the current shipping liner market increases above the expected freight index.\\nThe main effects of this insurance are as follows:\u2170) shipping companies can always secure nearly unchangeable freight, \u2171) shipping companies can secure relatively abundant liquid capital. and \u2172) shipping companies can make a quiet night sleep.\\nThe main side-effects of freight variation insurance are as follows:\u2170) the likelihood is that an adverse of selection will occur, \u2171) this insurance system which is not profit-making business necessitates securing funds.\\nThe freight variation insurance will surely cover the risk of steep freight rate variation in the shipping liner market. This insurance system will function as a new method to aid shipping companies."}]},"fpage":"437","lpage":"461","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.3.437","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.3.002","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001699945","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"09","volume":"28","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001699944","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc5f0\uc548\uc5ec\uac1d\uc5c5\uc758 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc95\uc81c\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Compensation Acts for Activating Coastal Passenger Routes"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Compensation Acts for Activating Coastal Passenger Routes"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uba85\uc7ac(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc5f0\uc548\uc5ec\uac1d\ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc95\ub9c8\ub828\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\uc900\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc2dc\uae30\uc640 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc94\uc704\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc5f0\uc548\uc5ec\uac1d\uc5c5\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uc744 \uc9c4\ub2e8\ud558\uace0 \uac01 \ud56d\ub85c\ubcc4 \ucde8\ud56d\uc5ec\uac1d\uc120\uc758 \ucd94\uc774\ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc678 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc5f0\uc721\uad50 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc5f0\uc548\uc5ec\uac1d\ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \ud53c\ud574\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc0ac\ub840\uc640 \ud310\ub840 \ub4f1\uc744 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uc5f0\uc721\uad50 \uacf5\uc0ac\uc640 \uad00\ub828\ud55c \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc95\uc548 \ubc0f \ubcf4\uc0c1\uc2dc\uae30\ub97c \ube44\ub86f\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\ubd80\uc801\uc778 \ud53c\ud574\ubcf4\uc0c1\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\ubc95\uc5d0 \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc95\uc548\uc740 \uadf8 \uadfc\uac70\uc640 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc94\uc704\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubaa8\ud638\ud558\uc5ec \uc5c5\uccb4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc2e4\uc9c8\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc6c0\uc774 \ub418\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c1\ud669\uc774\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70, \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ubcf4\uc0c1\ubc29\uc548\uc774 \uc870\uc18d\ud788 \ub9c8\ub828\ub418\uc5b4 \uc5f0\uc548\uc5ec\uac1d\uc0ac\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub3d9\uae30\ubd80\uc5ec\uc640, \uc815\ubd80\uc758 \uc5f0\uc548\ud574\uc6b4\uc721\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uc801 \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0, \uce5c\ud658\uacbd \uc218\uc1a1\uc5ec\uac74\ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uc548\uc5ec\uac1d\uc5c5\uc758 \uac74\uc804\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud568\uc774 \uc2dc\uae09\ud55c \uacfc\uc81c\ub85c \ub300\ub450\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study identifies a reasonable compensation act on the coastal passenger routes in Korea in case that a sea-land bridge should be constructed between the islands across the conventional routes.

According to the result of TSI analysis, the export competitiveness of Chinese shipbuilding industry is increasing(0.58\u21920.92) since 2003 while the competitiveness of Korean shipbuilding industry is decreasing(0.91\u21920.87). RSCA analysis shows that there exists big difference in competitiveness between Korea and China(Korea:0.80, China:0.39). Moreover, Korea has a comparative advantage in few types of ships such as tankers and special vessel, but China has a comparative advantage in various ships. In case of cargo ship, there will be expected to be a keen competition between Korea and China(2010: 0.78(Korea), 0.54(China)). However, In case of tankers and special vessel which requires high value added skills, Korea has higher competitiveness. The market share in shipbuilding industry of Korea and China is 28% and 24% respectively, but Korea occupies high market share in tankers and special vessels than China (Tanker: Korea-0.47, China-0.19, Special vessel: Korea-0.81, China-0.12).

This study research models and hypothesis in order to analyze those factors assuming that 9 factors affect the formation of swift trust and swift trust affects job satisfaction and organizational commitment. Based upon these finding, variables in the ship unit are analyzed through surveys.\\nThis research shows that sincerity, and reputation of captain and chief engineer have statistically a meaningful impact on the swift trust, and leaderships of captain and chief engineer, communication and shared common values have statistically a meaningful impact on swift trust. At the same time, the swift trust has statistically a meaningful and beneficial impact on organization effectiveness. I This study suggests that in order to establish a swift trust among crew members in the seagoing vessel, it is necessary to have an good reputation and transformational leadership of captain and chief engineer, facilitate communication and shared common values among crew members. This paper has its significance in practically proving that the established swift trust of crew members increase job satisfaction and organizational commitment."}]},"fpage":"353","lpage":"384","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.3.353","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.3.003","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001699941","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"09","volume":"28","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001699940","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120 \xb7 \ud654\uc8fc \ud611\ub825 \uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \uc8fc\uccb4\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Win-win Cooperative Strategies and Roles of Shippers and Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Win-win Cooperative Strategies and Roles of Shippers and Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc815\ubd09\ubbfc(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uace0\ubcd1\uc6b1(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc740 \ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801 \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ub2f4\ub2f9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ubbc0\ub85c \uc120 \xb7 \ud654\uc8fc \uc0c1\uc0dd\ubc1c\uc804\uc740 \uc30d\ubc29\uc758 \uac74\uc804\ud55c \ubc1c\uc804\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5 \uac04 \ud611\ub825\uccb4\uc81c \uad6c\ucd95\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \uc120 \xb7 \ud654\uc8fc \ud611\ub825 \ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uc7ac\uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud574\ub2f9 \ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uad6c\uc131\uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5 \uc774\ud574\uad00\uacc4\uc790\ub4e4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\ub2f9 \ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud588\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc120 \xb7 \ud654\uc8fc \ud611\ub825\uc758 \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5 \uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uc120 \xb7 \ud654 \xb7 \uc815 \ud611\uc758\uccb4 \uc6b4\uc601, \uc7a5\uae30 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d, \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5ed\ub7c9 \uac15\ud654 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc6b0\uc120\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uc774\uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ud611\ub825\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ubc95\uc801 \xb7 \uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uc7a5\uce58 \ub9c8\ub828, \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\ubb38\ud654 \uc815\ucc29, \uc790\ubcf8\ud611\ub825 \ub4f1\ub3c4 \uace0\ub824\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ud611\ub825 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc8fc\ub3c4\uc801 \ucd94\uc9c4 \uc8fc\uccb4\ub294 \ud654\uc8fc, \uc120\uc0ac, \uc815\ubd80, \uae08\uc735\uae30\uad00 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Shipping industry plays an important role in the supply chain of shippers, and accordingly, the cooperation between shipping companies and shippers is expected to be helpful for the sound growth of both the parties. In this study, a desirable cooperative model between the two parties is sought after based on various research results carried out so far in this area. To derive realistic and effective policy measures to implement the model, we carried out a survey on the stakeholders of shipping industry. According to the survey, such strategies as \u2170) carrying out cooperative measures through joint council consisting of the shipping companies, shippers and government authorities, \u2171) utilizing long-term shipping contracts as many as possible, \u2172) enhancing service capabilities of the shipping companies to cope with the shippers\' increasing demand for total logistics service and so on, among others, are regarded as very important for the establishment of cooperative system. On the other hand, the survey respondents think that the shippers should take the initiative for the establishment of cooperative framework in the first place, followed by shipping companies, government authorities, and then, financing institutes (or companies)."}]},"fpage":"325","lpage":"352","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.3.325","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.3.006","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001699940","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"06","volume":"28","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001676170","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc758

Also, this study provides various determinants of transshipment traffic volumes in the maritime industry. OLS regression is used to empirically investigate causal relationships among a dependent variable(transshipment traffic volumes), independent variables(quality of port, shipping network, trade volume, container volume, and port customs process), and a moderator(ICT capability). According to statistical results, shipping network, port customs process, and container volume are key determinants of transshipment traffic volumes in individual countries.

The effect of strategies on the Korean shipping industry was evaluated by means of the change rate of revenue per GT(CRGT) and revenue per ship(RPS). The strategies adopted for 1984 Shipping Rationalization Plan had positive effects on the both CRGT and RPS, showing that Korean shipping industry successfully had substituted economical fleet of ships for non economical fleet of ships. The strategies adopted for the time of IMF Bailout was fairly appropriate to promote internal stability. Finally the policies utilized in the case of Global Financial Crisis also led to desirable results in Korean shipping industry in terms of the movement of RPS."}]},"fpage":"143","lpage":"167","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.2.143","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.2.003","citation-count":"9","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001676129","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"03","volume":"28","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001649647","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\u300e\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958 \uc5f0\uad6c\u300f\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub3d9\ud5a5 \ubd84\uc11d - \ud559\ud68c\uc9c0 \uc81c61\ud638\ubd80\ud130 \uc81c70\ud638\uae4c\uc9c0\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of the Articles Published in The Journal of Shipping and Logistics - From Vol. 61 to Vol. 70. -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of the Articles Published in The Journal of Shipping and Logistics - From Vol. 61 to Vol. 70. -"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uae38\uc218(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \u300e\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\u300f \uc81c61\ud638\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c70\ud638\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uac8c\uc7ac \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub3d9\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc\uad00\ub9ac\uc640 \ud574\uc6b4\ubc95/\uad00\uc2b5 \ubc0f \ubb3c\ub958\uad00\ub9ac/\uc6b4\uc601 \ubd84\uc57c\uc758 \ub17c\ubb38\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub9ce\uc558\uace0, \uc5f0\uad6c\uc790 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad50\uc218\uc758 \ube44\uc728\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc558\uc73c\uba70 2\uc778 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \uac00\uc7a5\ub9ce\uc558\ub2e4. \ucc44\ud0dd\ub41c \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc218\ub9ac/\uacc4\ub7c9 \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc120\ud638\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\uba70 \uc124\ubb38\ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc904\uc5b4\ub4dc\ub294 \ubc18\uba74 \uacc4\ub7c9\ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc544\uc6b8\ub7ec \ucc38\uace0\ubb38\ud5cc\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc778\uc6a9\uc218\ub294 29.9\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c\uc9c0\ub09c \ubc88 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \u300e\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c\u300f\uc758 \ud53c \uc778\uc6a9\uac74\uc218\ub294 \ud3c9\uade0 2.9\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c\uc81c 51\ud638\ubd80\ud130 \uc81c 60\ud68c\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \ud3c9\uade0\uc778 1.3\ud3b8\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uc99d\uac00\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper analyzed tendency of research of articles published in the Journal of Shipping and Logistics from Vol. 61 to Volume 70.

Past several decades have seen this doctrine to be proved inconvenient to commercial practice, especially those concerned with carriage of goods by sea. This may explain why the accumulation of judicially created exceptions to the privity of contract doctrine has strong shipping connections. As carriers\' obligations in contract, tort, and restitution can coexist with each other, third parties, whether a servant, an agent, or an independent contractor in connection with a contract of affreightment evidenced by bills of lading, may assume similar obligations in tort or bailment.\\nThe question is whether third parties can also enjoy the benefits of, or be burdened with, the obligations of a contract to which they are not parties. The contractual terms that mostly affect third-party interests are exception clauses. This Article addresses whether third-party interests will be affected by contractual exception clauses related to the carriage of goods by sea especially when the cause of action is based on bailment.

As the results of factor analysis, the internal resources were categorized into social, financial and physical resources and firm performance was typified into strategic and operational performance. Then, ANOVA test was carried out to examine the statistical differences in firm performance according to the three types of internal resources. The results show that strategic performance is influenced by physical resources while operational performance is affected by social resources. In addition, physical resources enable the container terminal operators to avoid below-average performance but don\'t guarantee above-average performance. On the contrary, social resources help them not only avoid below-average performance but also achieve above-average performance. It implies whereas physical resources are the essential condition not the sufficient one, social resources can act as the sufficient condition for improving firm performance."}]},"fpage":"33","lpage":"64","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2012.28.1.33","uci":"G704-000463.2012.28.1.005","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001649641","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2012","pub-mon":"03","volume":"28","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001649638","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc815\uae30\uc120 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uba38\uc2a4\ud06c \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc544\uc2dc\uc544-\ubd81\uc720\ub7fd \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \uc2e0(\u65b0)\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study of the Maersk New Service that Provide Daily Liner Service between Europe-Far East Root in the Change of Liner Market Paradigm"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study of the Maersk New Service that Provide Daily Liner Service between Europe-Far East Root in the Change of Liner Market Paradigm"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc774\ud0dc\ud76c(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc740 \ud0c0 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uacfc\ub294 \ub2ec\ub9ac \ud638\ud669\uacfc \ubd88\ud669\uc758 \uc8fc\uae30\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uae34 \ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4. 1995\ub144 WTO\uc758 \ucd9c\ubc94\uc740 \uc138\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uad50\uc5ed\uc758 \ud655\ub300\ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uae08\uc735\uc790\ubcf8\uc744 \ube44\ub86f\ud55c \ub9ce\uc740 \uc790\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \uc138\uacc4\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub04c\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uacbd\uae30\uc758 \uc21c\ud658\uc5d0 \uc885\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ud574\uc6b4\uacbd\uae30\ub294 \uc138\uacc4\ud654\uc5d0 \ud798\uc785\uc5c8\ub358 10\ub144\uc758 \ud638\ud669\uc744 \ub9c8\uce58\uace0 \uc9c0\uae08\uc740 \ub2e4\uc2dc \ubd88\ud669\uc758 \uc8fc\uae30\uc5d0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc9c0\uae08\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4 \ubd88\ud669\uc740 \uc8fc\uae30\uc131 \uc678\uc5d0 \ud070 \uc0ac\uc870\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc218\ubc18\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ube44\ub2e8 \uc138\uacc4\uacbd\uae30\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uce68\uccb4 \uc678\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uba74 \ud574\uc6b4\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc678\ubd80\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\ub294 \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub4e4\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4.\\n\uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uc678\ubd80\ud658\uacbd\ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uc138\uacc4 1\uc704 \uba38\uc2a4\ud06c \uc120\uc0ac\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ud328\ub7ec\ub2e4\uc784\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc778 \uba38\uc2a4\ud06c \ub370\uc77c\ub9ac \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ub2e8\uc21c\ud788 \uc120\ubcf5 \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ud574\uc0c1\uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc54c\uc544\ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2a4\ud06c \uc120\uc0ac\uac00 \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc77c\ub9ac \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub294 \ud654\uc8fc \uc704\uc8fc\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub85c \ud574\uc0c1\uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\uc791\ub418\uba70, \uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uacfc \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\uac00 \uc874\uc7ac\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\ub2e4. \uba38\uc2a4\ud06c \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \ud574\uc0c1\uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud30c\ud2b8\ub108\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \ud611\uc5c5\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ubd84\uc11d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \ud574\uc0c1\uacf5\uae09\uc0ac\uc2ac\uad00\ub9ac\uc758 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uacfc \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this paper first is to know how threatening factors exist on the Asia-Europe liner service among external/internal factors ; economical, technical, environmental, legal, political factors based on the Resource Based Theory and Contingency Theory.

We analyzed investment result of ship investment company by means of Market Adjusted Return Method for measurement of abnormal return(AR) and cumulative abnormal return(CAR). Some implications from the results of this study are suggested. First, we find that the initial abnormal return of IPO, 30-day CAR and long-term CAR are not significantly different between A and B shipping fund management company. And then, the initial abnormal return of IPO and long-term CAR are not significantly different between newbuilding and secondhand ship SIC. But the 30-day CAR is significantly different between newbuilding and secondhand vessel SIC.

This research develops a conceptual model in order to determine how and to what extent ship fueling service quality and customer satisfaction towards customer loyalty are related and examine the moderating role of switching barriers. To achieve research objective, sixteen hypotheses were developed on the basis of literature review and interviews and empirically tested using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The findings of this study demonstrate positive impact of reliability, responsiveness and assurance on customer loyalty through customer satisfaction. However, the moderating effects of switching barriers were not confirmed in the ship fueling industry context.

However, NSR route can be financially feasible to operate a shipping service on the NSR when the transit fee, especially icebreaker escort fee, are cut with at least 85% based on the current level, the fee structure is modernized and only actually services are charged, large container ship, preferably operating independent of icebreakers, are used to keep the slot costs low."}]},"fpage":"583","lpage":"605","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2011.27.4.583","uci":"G704-000463.2011.27.4.010","citation-count":"22","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001620064","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2011","pub-mon":"12","volume":"27","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001620045","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d \ubc0f \uc720\ub7fd \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Relative Efficiency of Major Ports in China and Europe"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Relative Efficiency of Major Ports in China and Europe"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc5ec\ud76c\uc815(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d\uacfc \uc720\ub7fd \uc8fc\uc694\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574\uc911\uad6d \ud56d\ub9cc 10\uac1c, \uc720\ub7fd \ud56d\ub9cc 10\uac1c \ucd1d 20\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c 2009\ub144 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c DEA\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud56d\ub9cc\ubcc4 \uae30\uc220\ud6a8\uc728\uc131(technical efficiency), \uc21c\uc218\uae30\uc220 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131(\uacbd\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\uc131, pure technical efficiency), \uaddc\ubaa8\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131(scale efficiency)\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uc0c1\ud574 \ud56d, \ud64d\ucf69 \ud56d, \uc120\uc804 \ud56d, \ub2dd\ubcf4 \ud56d, \ub840\uc708\uac15 \ud56d, \uc774\ud0c8\ub9ac\uc544\uc758 \uc9c0\uc624\uc774\uc544 \ud0c0\uc6b0\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper examines the relative efficiency of European and Chinese major ports.

An optimum investment strategy on the vessel gives shipping companies the maximized firm value. For evaluating more accurate firm value, accounting information has a limitation that contains only borrowed capital cost information but EVA has a usefulness that contains the information of borrowed and stakeholder\'s capital cost. In this point of view, this study studies what financial characteristics as a financial decision-making are effect to economic value added as the firm value in the Korea shipping industry. As results of panel data analysis by EVA and financial indicators, operating income to sales, return on asset and net income to sales are observed by critical factors with EVA. As operating income to sales shows a regression coefficient of 0.84508, it can be considered the most important factor to increase EVA. Finally, operating income to sales and return on asset show a positive coefficient with EVA but net income to sales observed a negative coefficient. This result is likely driven by the financial cost. Although a negative relationship is observed, operating income to sales need to be considered as a important factor to increase firm value. It can be explained that determinants of firm value is variety by purpose of firm value estimate and industrial characteristics."}]},"fpage":"517","lpage":"544","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2011.27.4.517","uci":"G704-000463.2011.27.4.006","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001620021","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2011","pub-mon":"09","volume":"27","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001592535","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uac1c\ub7c9\ud615 \ud55c\uc120\uc758 \ud56d\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Earthen Pot Carrier\'s Sailing Performance"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Earthen Pot Carrier\'s Sailing Performance"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc131\uc900(\uad6d\ub9bd\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\ud604\uace4(\ub300\uc591\ud56d\ud574\uac00)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uc120\uc740 \ub204\uc218\uc640 \uc801\uc7ac\ub7c9\uc774 \ubd80\uc871\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ub2e8\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \ubc18\uba74, \uc5ed\ud48d \ud56d\ud574\uc131\ub2a5\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc7a5\uc810\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc801\ub418\uc5b4 \uc654\ub2e4. \uc5b8\ub354\uc6b0\ub4dc \ubc15\uc0ac\ub294 \ud55c\uc120\uc774 67\ub3c4 30\ubd84\uae4c\uc9c0 \uc5ed\ud48d \ud56d\ud574\ub97c \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4\uace0 \ubc1d\ud788\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uc774\ub97c \uc785\uc99d\ud560\ub9cc\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uc774\ub098 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ud56d\ud574\uac00 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c4 \uc801\uc740 \uc5c6\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 2010\ub144 9\uc6d4 \uad6d\ub9bd\ud574\uc591\ubb38\ud654\uc7ac\uc5f0\uad6c\uc18c\uac00 \ubcf5\uc6d0\ud55c \uac15\uc9c4 \uc639\uae30\ubc30\ub97c \uac15\uc9c4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc5ec\uc218\uae4c\uc9c0 3\uc77c \uac04 \uc2e4\uc81c \uc6b4\ud56d\ud574 \ubcf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1a0\ub300\ub85c \ud55c\uc120\uc758 \ud56d\ud574 \uc131\ub2a5\uc744 \uc2e4\uc99d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac80\uc99d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc774 \uc2dc\ud5d8 \ud56d\ud574\ub294 \ucd1d 82.7\ub9c8\uc77c, 28\uc2dc\uac04 22\ubd84 \ub3d9\uc548\uc758 \ud56d\ud574 \uc911 20.63\ub9c8\uc77c, 9\uc2dc\uac04 57\ubd84 30\ucd08 \ub3d9\uc548 \ubc94\uc8fc \ud56d\ud574\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ud3c9\uade0 \ubc94\uc8fc \uc18d\ub825 2.07\ub178\ud2b8\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5b8\ub354\uc6b0\ub4dc\uac00 \uc5b8\uae09\ud55c \ud55c\uc120\uc758 \ucd5c\uace0\uc18d\ub825 3-4\ub178\ud2b8\uc5d0\ub294 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud588\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc0ac\uacf5\uc774 \ub178\ub839\uc778 \uc810, \uae30\ud0c0 \uc120\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \ud56d\ud574 \uacbd\ud5d8\uc774 \uc77c\ucc9c\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810, \uc608\uc778 \uc18d\ub825\uc774 2.77\ub178\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ubd88\uacfc\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810 \ub4f1\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uba74 \uadf8\ub9ac \ub290\ub9b0 \uc18d\ub825\uc740 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c\uace0 \ud3c9\uac00\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub9de\ubc14\ub78c \ud56d\ud574\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0, \ube44\ub85d \uc9e7\uc740 \uad6c\uac04\uc774\uc5c8\uc9c0\ub9cc, \uc57d 60\ub3c4\uae4c\uc9c0 \uac70\uc2ac\ub7ec \ud56d\ud574\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c\uc120\uc758 \uc5ed\ud48d\ud56d\ud574\ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uc6b0\uc218\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc774 \uc785\uc99d\ub41c \uac83\uc740 \uc18c\uc911\ud55c \uc218\ud655\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The traditional Korean Ship \\"Hanseon\\" has been pointed out leakage and little capacity as a weakpoint, but outstanding capability of sailing against the wind as a strongpoint.

But until today, there has been none of simulation or trial sailing to prove his statement. The authors present new data on the sailing performance of Earthen Pot Carrier, a modernized Korean sailing ship, which sailed 82.7 mile in 28 hours 22 minutes from September 8, 2010 to September 10, 2010. The ship sailed 2.07 knots in 9 hours 57 minutes 30 seconds for 20.63 miles only with sails. The average sailing speed was 2.07 knots which was below 3 or 4 knots Dr. Underwood mentioned. But in consideration of quite a old skipper, none of capable sailors onboard except 2 yachties, and towed speed of 2.77 knots, it was not a bad result.

The court applied the tort of negligence. However, this judgment was denied by the Seoul High Civil Court and the Supreme Court confirmed the High Court decision. There was an express rental contract for the liquid cargo tank between the tank owner and the consignee for two years. Nevertheless, the district court claimed the owner of storage tank is an fulfillment assistant of the ocean carrier and a cargo storage contract is implied between the tank owner and the carrier.

Especially, Gwangyang port is struggling to revitalize the port because of low port traffic due to the lack of transport networks and industrial base in hinterland. Building a freight only transport network between Busan and Gwnagyang port is one of alternatives to overcome the Gwangyang port\'s problem. In this paper, we forecast traffic demand between Busan and Gwnagyang port for each transportation mode, trucking, rail, marine, and freight only rail. Based on survey results, we estimate mode split ratio using Analytical Hierarchy Processes and Multi-nominal Logit Model. Also, we forecast traffic demand for each mode between Busan and Gwnagyang port up to 2020 by applying the estimated mode split ratio to OD and demand forecast of the two ports."}]},"fpage":"193","lpage":"216","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2011.27.2.193","uci":"G704-000463.2011.27.2.003","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001564587","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2011","pub-mon":"06","volume":"27","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001564579","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Market Stabilization Schemes of Busan Container Stevedore Market"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Market Stabilization Schemes of Busan Container Stevedore Market"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae38\uad11\uc218(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc81c1\uc704\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc778 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 \uc2e0\ud56d \uac1c\uc7a5 \ubc0f \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30 \uc5ec\ud30c\ub85c \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801\uc778 \uc218\uae09\ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud568\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ubd80\ub450\uc6b4\uc601\uc0ac \uac04 \uacfc\ub2f9\uacbd\uc7c1\uc73c\ub85c \ubd88\uc548\uc815\ud55c \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0 \ub193\uc5ec\uc788\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \ud6c4, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc548\uc815\ud654\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uadf8 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc6b4\uc601\uc0ac\uc758 \uc218 \uacfc\ub2e4 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\ub2e8\uc704 \uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8, \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc131 \uc2ec\ud654, \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc9d1\uc911\ub960\uc758 \ud558\ub77d\ucd94\uc138 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uad6c\uc870\ub85c \ubcc0\ubaa8\ud574 \uac00\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc77c\uc2dc\uc801 \uc218\uae09\ubd88\uade0\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\ub450\uc6b4\uc601\uc0ac \uac04 \ud558\uc5ed\uc694\uc728 \uc778\ud558\uacbd\uc7c1 \ub4f1 \uacfc\ub2f9\uacbd\uc7c1\uc774 \uace0\uc870\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc774\uc724\uc728\uc758 \ud558\ub77d\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc800\ud558 \ub4f1 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc131\uacfc\uac00 \uc545\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ubd88\uc548\uc815 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uad00\uacc4\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790 \uac04 \uc9c4\ub2e8\uacfc \ucc98\ubc29\uc774 \uc0c1\uc774\ud55c \ubc14, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \ub3c5\ud2b9\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc870\uc9c1\uc801 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \uae30\ucd08\ud55c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc548\uc815\ud654 \ub300\ucc45 \uc218\ub9bd\uc774 \uae34\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud558\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc548\uc815\ud654\uc2dc\ud0a4\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucc98\ub9ac\ubb3c\ub7c9 \uc0c1\ud55c\uc81c \ub4f1\uc758 \uc218\uae09\uad00\ub9ac \uac15\ud654, \uac1c\ubc1c\uc815\ucc45\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uc5f0\uacc4, \uc6b4\uc601\uad6c\uc870 \uac1c\ud3b8 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\ub2e8\uc704 \ud655\ub300, \ud56d\ub9cc\uc0b0\uc5c5\uacbd\uc7c1\uc815\ucc45 \uc218\ub9bd \uc2dc\ud589, \uc801\uc815 \ud558\uc5ed\uc694\uc728 \uc0b0\uc815 \ubc0f \ub364\ud551\ud589\uc704 \uaddc\uc81c, \uc120\uc0ac\uc640\uc758 \ud611\ub825 \uac15\ud654, \uc6b4\uc601\uc0ac \uac04 \ud611\ub825 \uac15\ud654, \ucc98\ub9ac\ubb3c\ub7c9\uacfc \uc5f0\ub3d9\ud55c \uc784\ub300\ub8cc \uccb4\uacc4\uc758 \ud0c4\ub825\uc801 \uc801\uc6a9 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The container stevedore market in Busan port is very unstable because of the temporary supply-demand imbalance due to Busan New Port open and the global financial crisis.

The analysis result shows that the competitions among the container stevedore companies of Busan port are overheated and this is worsening the financial and operating performance of the companies. To prevent the market turmoil, establishment of the market stabilization measures based on the characteristics of stevedore market is very urgent. Therefore, this paper proposes several market stabilization schemes like fortifying the supply and demand management(including upper bound system on container throughputs per container berth), joint policy making between development and operation, improvement of operating structure, enlargement of operating unit, assessment of proper stevedoring tariffs, strengthen cooperation with shipping companies, cooperation between terminal operators, and a flexible terminal lease system considering container throughputs, and so on."}]},"fpage":"169","lpage":"191","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2011.27.2.169","uci":"G704-000463.2011.27.2.006","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001564579","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2011","pub-mon":"03","volume":"27","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001539970","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"1990\ub144 \uc720\ub958\uc624\uc5fc\ubc95\uc0c1\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c - \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc \uc6d0\uc720\uc720\ucd9c\uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Liability System under Oil Pollution Act 1990 - Focused on the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Liability System under Oil Pollution Act 1990 - Focused on the Gulf of Mexico Oil Spill -"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ud55c\ub099\ud604(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc \uc6d0\uc720\uc720\ucd9c\uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc694\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \ud6c4 1990\ub144 OPA \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ub3c4\uc640 \ubbfc\uc0ac\ucc45\uc784\ud611\uc57d(CLC)\u2024\ubcf4\uc0c1\uae30\uae08\ud611\uc57d(FC)\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uadf8\uac83\uc744 \ube44\uad50\uace0\ucc30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4.\\n\uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc \uc720\ub958\uc720\ucd9c\uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc \uc8fc\uc704\uc758 \uc8fc\ubbfc, \ud658\uacbd\uacfc \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ube44\uadf9\uc801\uc774\uba70 \uacf5\ud3ec\uc801\uc778 \uc0ac\uace0\uc774\ub2e4. 2010\ub144 4\uc6d4 20\uc77c, \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc\uc5d0\uc11c \uc601\uad6d BP\uc0ac\uc758 Deepwater Horizon \uc11d\uc720\uc2dc\ucd94\uc2dc\uc124\uc774 \ud3ed\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc11d\uc720\uc2dc\ucd94\uac00 \uc9c4\ud589 \uc911\uc774\ub358 \uc2dc\ucd94\uacf5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6d0\uc720\uac00 \ubd80\uadfc\uc758 \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ud758\ub7ec \ub4e4\uc5b4\uac14\uc73c\uba70, \ubbf8\uad6d \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc0c1 \ucd5c\uc545\uc758 \ud574\uc0c1\uc720\ub958\uc720\ucd9c\uc0ac\uace0\ub97c \uc77c\uc73c\ucf30\ub2e4. \uc774\ub85c \uc778\ud558\uc5ec 11\uba85\uc758 \uc2dc\ucd94 \ub178\ub3d9\uc790\uac00 \uc0ac\ub9dd\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc57d 490\ub9cc \ubc30\ub7f4\uc758 \uc6d0\uc720\uac00 \uc720\ucd9c\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. 2012\ub144 \ub9d0\uc5d0 \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc \uc6d0\uc720\uc720\ucd9c\uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \ud68c\ubcf5\ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uad6d \uc815\ubd80\ub294 \uc601\uad6d\uc758 BP\uc0ac\uac00 \uc774 \ud574\uc591\uc7ac\ub09c\uc5d0 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc838\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc9c0\ubaa9\ud558\uc600\uace0, \uc815\uce58\uc778\ub4e4\uacfc \uacf5\ubb34\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc740 BP\uc0ac\uac00 \uadf8 \ucc98\ub9ac\uc640 \ubcf5\uad6c\ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \ubd80\ub2f4\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc99d\uac70\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec BP\uc0ac\ub294 \uba55\uc2dc\ucf54\ub9cc \uc6d0\uc720\uc720\ucd9c\uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc29\uc624\ub97c \uc778\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill is a very tragic and horrific incident affecting the people, environment and economy in and around the Gulf of Mexico.

To serve this transportation need, the size of the container carrier is getting larger. The global ports are required to deepen the waterways as well as to prepare infrastructure to serve these super-size container carriers. However, few ports around the world could meet the requirements. To solve these difficulties, the concept of the Mobile Harbor has been developed.\\nAn onboard Automatic Storage and Retrieval System(AS/RS) has been proposed for the B1 type Mobile Harbor to maximize the container throughput within the limited space of the Mobile Harbor. A scenario of operations and freight movements of the B1 type Mobile Harbor is prepared and the storage size of the B1 type Mobile Harbor through the computer simulation is estimated. The size of the Mobile Harbor and the size of the AS/RS has also been estimated.

In an effort to diversify primary energy sources, Korea started to import natural gas in 1986, and its share in the imported energy sources has increased over time. With heightened uncertainty of energy prices and emerging natural resource nationalism Korea has developed serious policy measures to secure stable energy supply while given little attention to the types of transport and its fleet size to transport the resources from the loading port to the unloading port in Korea.\\nIn this paper an effort is made to assess at macro level by using a non-parametric approach if the current level of LNG fleet capacity in 2009 is sufficient enough to transport Korea\'s future import demand for natural gas. The results show that irrespective of the three different scenarios for the monthly voyage frequency of LNG carrier an excess demand for LNG tanker carrier will be created, exerting an upward pressure on the freight rate."}]},"fpage":"1","lpage":"20","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2011.27.1.1","uci":"G704-000463.2011.27.1.007","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001539933","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"12","volume":"26","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001511923","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc11c\ud574\uc548\uc2dc\ub300\uc640 \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d \ubc1c\uc804\uc804\ub7b5"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Development Strategy of Dangjin Port in the Era of Yellow Sea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Development Strategy of Dangjin Port in the Era of Yellow Sea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud55c\uc885\uae38(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc815\ud0dc\uc6d0(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \ud658\ud669\ud574\uad8c \uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ub3c4\ub798\ub85c \uc778\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc640 \uc911\uad6d\uacfc\uc758 \uad50\uc5ed\ub7c9\uc740 \uafb8\uc900\ud788 \ub298\uc5b4\ub098\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc11c\ud574\uc548 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uac1c\ubc1c \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ubd80\uac01\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc740 \uc544\uc9c1 \uc11c\ud574\uc548 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\uc640 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc2dc\uc124\ud22c\uc790 \ubc0f \ub0ae\uc740 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\uace0 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud55c \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc801 \ucd94\uc9c4\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uacfc \uc2e4\ud589\ubc29\uc548\uc774 \uc2dc\uae09\ud788 \uc694\uad6c\ub418\ub294 \uc2dc\uc810\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc758 \ube44\uc804\uacfc \ubc1c\uc804\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uacb0\ub860\uc801\uc73c\ub85c, \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc740 \uc911\ubd80\uad8c \uc911\uc2ec\ud56d \ubc0f \uc218\ub3c4\uad8c \ubd84\ub2f4\ud56d\ub9cc\uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ud658\ud669\ud574\uacbd\uc81c\uad8c\uc758 \uc885\ud569\ubb3c\ub958\uac70\uc810\ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc721\uc131\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uccab\uc9f8, \ucda9\ub0a8\uc9c0\uc5ed \ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \uc5f0\uacc4\ud55c \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d \uad11\uc5ed\ud654\ub85c \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc744 \ubd80\uac00\uac00\uce58 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ucda9\uccad \ubc0f \uc218\ub3c4\uad8c\uc758 \ub300 \uc911\uad6d\uad00\ubb38\ud56d\uc758 \uc9c0\uc704\ub97c \ud655\ubcf4\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4, \ub458\uc9f8, \ub300\uc911\uad6d \ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \uac70\uc810\ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ubc1c\uc804\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ucd08\uc778\ud504\ub77c\ub85c \uc11d\ubb38\ud56d\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\uc5ec \ud55c\uc911\uac04 \ud398\ub9ac\ud56d\ub85c \uc720\uce58\uc640 \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\ubc30\ud6c4\uc9c0\uc5ed \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc720\uce58, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ub2f9\uc9c4\ud56d\uc758 \uc11c\ud574\uc548\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uae30\ub2a5\uacfc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ud569\ubc1c\uc804\uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The annual amount and volume of trade between Korea and China have recorded a sharp increase with the advent of pan yellow region period. especially the importance of west coast ports in Korea is being emphasized In this point this paper proposed Dangjin port\' development strategy to be the logistics and China business hub of pan yellow-sea region in the Era of Yellow sea.

For these port\'s development, this paper suggests four policy implications, specialization, linkage, background area, passenger transportation."}]},"fpage":"833","lpage":"855","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.4.833","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.4.003","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001511910","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"12","volume":"26","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001511883","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uccb4\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Impact of Strategic Collaboration with Truck Carriers on Providers\' Service Performance and User\'s Supply Chain Performance"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Impact of Strategic Collaboration with Truck Carriers on Providers\' Service Performance and User\'s Supply Chain Performance"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud558\ubcd1\ucc9c(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\uc131\ube48(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \ud611\ub825\uc774 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uccb4\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud558\uc5ec \uace0\ucc30\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\ub294 \uc120\ud0dd\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub9cc \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640 \ud611\ub825\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ub9fa\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uad00\uacc4\ub294 \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub098 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uccb4\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba70, \ud2b8\ub7ed\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc131\uacfc\ub294 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790\uc758 \uacf5\uae09\uccb4\uc778 \uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study investigates the impact of strategic collaboration with motor carriers on users\' satisfaction level and organizational performance in U.S. Even though the collaboration with their motor carriers has an significant impact on organizational performance, firms collaborate with motor carriers in selective areas.

In these circumstances, it is essential to adopt an effective management system which can cope with a change in business environment and improve business performance to get competitive power in the international shipping market. This study is summarized as follows;Firstly, five core processes in shipping companies have causal relationship mutually and they effect on business performance. Also, staffs of Korean shipping companies put an importance in ship operating management, crew management, ship management, shore based personnel management and management responsibility in order. This means that the ship operation management is the process which accepts customers\u2019 demands and realizes them resulting in freight, and other processes mean supporting processes for successful shipping.\\nSecondly, 5 core processes affect more on an increase in profit than cost reduction. According to the result of Kendall\u2019s rating verification, there is a causal relationship as effective orderly in a decrease of accident rate, an increase of ship operation rate, a rise of customer satisfaction, an increase of timely operation rate, a reduction of insurance rate, an increase of sales and net income, and a reduction of operational expenses. Thirdly, 5 core processes affect on after the other to shipping companies\u2019 performance.\\nAccording to this study management of Korean shipping companies are recommended to consider this effect relationship and manage the process in stages to maximize the effect of cost reduction and the effect of profit increase. The estimates of the elasticities of substitution indicate that capital and labor are complements; while capital and labor are both substitutable with variable input."}]},"fpage":"713","lpage":"739","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.4.713","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.4.008","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001511857","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"12","volume":"26","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001511850","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac04 \uc720\ud1b5\uacbd\ub85c \ubc0f \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of Distribution Channels and Portfolio between the Port of Busan and Major Japanese Ports to Induce the Transshipment Cargo"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of Distribution Channels and Portfolio between the Port of Busan and Major Japanese Ports to Induce the Transshipment Cargo"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc728\uc131(\ubd80\uc0b0\ubc1c\uc804\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0)","\uc774\uc9c0\ud6c8(\ubd80\uc0b0\ubc1c\uc804\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0)","\uae40\uc0c1\uc5f4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud658\uc801\ud654\ubb3c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc740 \uc911\uad6d\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8\uc774 \ub300\ud45c\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac04\uc758 \ud658\uc801\ud654\ubb3c \uc99d\uac00\uc728\uc774 6\u223c8%\ub85c \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ub192\uc740 \uc99d\uac00\uc728\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc720\ud1b5\uacbd\ub85c(O/D)\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ubc0f \uc77c\ubcf8 \ud658\uc801\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 20\ub300 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubcc4 \ud3ec\ud2b8\ud3f4\ub9ac\uc624 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud654\ubb3c\uc720\uce58\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub300\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uacfc \ud658\uc801\ud654\ubb3c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\uacfc \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc774 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \ub192\uc740 \ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc740 Hakata\ud56d, Yokohama\ud56d, Tomakomai\ud56d, Nagoya\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c, \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\uc740 \uc911\uac04\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc774 \ubcf4\uc5ec \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ud575\uc2ec \ud658\uc801\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uc7a5\ud558\uac8c \ub420 \ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc740 Kitakyushu\ud56d(Moji\ud56d), Shibushi\ud56d, Toyamashinko\ud56d, Fukuyama\ud56d, Naha\ud56d\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub3d9\uc548\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 Kobe\ud56d, Osaka\ud56d, Tokyo\ud56d, Hiroshima\ud56d \ub4f1\uc740 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \ube44\uc911\ub3c4 \uc810\ucc28 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \uad70\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ud658\uc801\ud654\ubb3c \uc720\uce58\uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \uae30\ucd08\uc790\ub8cc\ub85c \ud65c\uc6a9\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The increase in the transshipment cargo between the port of Busan and Japan has relatively high and increased 6~8%.

This paper suggests the alternatives for the inducement of transshipment cargo through the distribution channel analysis(O/D) in major Japanese ports and the portfolio analysis between the port of Busan and major twenty ports in Japan in terms of transshipment cargo. The result of analysis refers that the ports of Hakata, Yokohama, and Nagoya have rather high market shares and growth rates in terms of the transshipment cargo with the port of Busan. Besides, the ports of Kitakyushu(Moji), Shibushi, Toyamashinko, Fukuyama, and Naha have relatively high growth rate despite of the averaged market shares so that these ports are highly likely to be the main transshipment port for the port of Busan. Finally, the eastern parts of regions including the ports of Kobe, Osaka, Tokyo, and Hiroshima have become less significant and decreased in growth rate.

In his days, it was very rare for a Yangban to work on commerce except learning Confucius Philosophy. After death of his parent and collapse of his wife\'s family, he had to employ himself on business such as fishing and saltpan for keeping up his own family and his wife\'s family. By having experienced these he could take a shape of his ideas on giving an importance on fishing and saltpan, mining, water transportation.

He asserted that even the Yangban had to engage in business and government had to inspire the people for making their own living by doing fishing, saltpan, manufacturing and water transportation.

Since 2005, International Maritime Organization has expressed concern over the rise in acts of piracy.\\nIn the Bunga Melati Dua, it is the claimant\u2019s primary case that on the capture of the vessel by the pirates and its removal into Somali waters the cargo became an actual total loss in terms of s. 57(1) of the MIA in that the assured had been irretrievably deprived of the cargo. In the alternative the claimant asserted that there had been a constructive total loss under s. 60(1) of the MIA in that the vessel and cargo had been reasonably abandoned on account of its actual total loss appearing to be unavoidable. The court was concluded that the claimant has not made out its claim for a total loss whether actual or constructive.

This study also employs the panel technique to analyse the effects of PTC, PCC, and PYT on the changes of Malmquist productivity and technical efficiency. The dependent variables are obtained from three combinations, which are (TC, C/C, and TS), (TC, YT, and TS) and (TS, YT, and TS). The empirical results show that all of the explanatory variables have a positive effect on the change of Malmquist productivity and technical efficiency. Furthermore our findings reveal that the coefficient of TC is larger than that of C/C and YT and the coefficient of YT is greater than that of C/C.

However, from some years ago two ports have been confronted with serious problems due to the fierce competition between them. To cope with these problems, various measures could be considered. Consolidation of the operations of the two ports, however, is indispensible and most desirable among many alternatives. Under this background, this paper analyses the necessity of the consolidation of the two ports for the construction of cooperative relationship. The purpose of the consolidation lies in the construction of cooperative relationship between two ports through weakening the excessive competition, prevention of unnecessary price reduction, and facilitation of the construction of the Hub function in Northeast Asia. Through the analysis, partial consolidation which composed of the consolidation of the operations and development of the container terminals of the two ports is more better method rather than complete consolidation which composed of the consolidation of the two port authorities.

However, the cargo volume has stagnated since 2007 due to the changes in the shipping industry and logistics business environment surrounding Gwangyang Port. Gwangyang Port should respond to the market by introducing a port authority system to achieve management innovation and finally improve the port\'s productivity and service. A port authority should have a sense of ownership and more aggressively carry out the innovative management and marketing to increase Gwangyang Port\'s competitiveness. This study reviewed previous studies to deduce four independent variables (service, infrastructure, management system, characteristics of agencies) and a dependent variable (effects of introduction) and carried out multiple regression analyses. The results of analyses revealed that the service factors (e.g. streamlining of port administrative service; user-oriented customized service and marketing; addition of new sea routes; improvement in the labor supply system) and the system management factors (unification of the port management system; tax, financial, and incentive support; attracting new customers and managing existing customers; nurturing port-related industries; port security) are significant in terms of the effects of introduction. The analysis results also suggested points to consider for the efficient operation of a port authority to be established at Gwangyang Port. Once launched, the port authority should first make efforts to increase the cargo volume by generating new cargos. The points to consider for efficient operation of the port authority suggested in this study should be actively taken into accounts to secure more cargo volume."}]},"fpage":"541","lpage":"560","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.3.541","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.3.008","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001483657","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"09","volume":"26","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001483652","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc911\uad6d \ubb3c\ub958 \ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ube44\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc81c3\uc790 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc81c\uc5b8"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Strategies for Korean Third-party Logistics Firms Preparing to Change Chinese Logistics Market"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Strategies for Korean Third-party Logistics Firms Preparing to Change Chinese Logistics Market"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc784\uc601\uc138(\uc804\uc8fc\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\uad11\uc11c(\uc804\uc8fc\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d\uc740 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc7a5\uacfc \ubb34\uc5ed\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud655\ub300\ub85c \uc218\ucd9c\uc785\ubb3c\ub7c9\uc774 \uc99d\uac00\ud560 \ubfd0\ub9cc \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c \uc911\uad6d \ub0b4\uc218\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\ub3c4 \uc99d\uac00\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc911\uad6d\uc758 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc774 \ub9e4\ub144 \uae09\uc131\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uaddc\ubaa8\ub3c4 \ub9e4\ub144 \ub192\uc740 \uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc744 \ubcf4\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub294\ub370 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc7a5\ub960\uc744 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc774 \ub530\ub77c\uac00\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud574 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb3c\ub958\ube44\uc6a9\uc774 \ub9ce\uc774 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4.\\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0, \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc81c3\uc790 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \uc911\uad6d\ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc9c4\uc785\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud569\ub9ac\uc801\uc778 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\uc55e\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c3\uc790 \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc774 \uc138\uacc4 \uc81c1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0c1\ud560 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\uc774 \ud070 \uc911\uad6d\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uad50\ub450\ubcf4\ub97c \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc911\uad6d \uacbd\uc81c \ud604\ud669\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uace0\uac1d \uc218\uc775\uc131, \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc131\uacfc \ud6a8\uc728\uc131, \uc7ac\ubb34\uad00\ub9ac \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ub4f1\uc758 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \ub2e8\uacc4\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucc28\ubcc4\ud654\ub41c \ucd94\uc9c4\uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ucd94\uc9c4\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"China\'s logistics and express industry is enjoying a period of spectacular growth helped by economic development and the increased acceptance of out-sourcing by Chinese manufacturers and retailers.

Previous studies focused on the business conditions of companies that entered the Chinese market, leaving studies on global logistics insufficient. In order to examine barriers of global logistics, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) approach is used. The AHP analysis shows that the Korean companies have difficulties in order of the interference and bureaucracy of the local and central governments, the burden of taxes due to change in tax system, the high increase of wages, and the difficulty of financing in the regional market. It is necessary to construct an on-site completion management system to get over problems of global logistics. It would be a priority to conduct management system ranging over all sections, including planning, R& D, supply, and production and selling.

This decision reaffirmed that the normal measure of damages for late redelivery is limited to the difference between the charter rate and the market rate for the period of the overrun.

But specific forms or modified forms do not contain such an express warranty, where it is disputable whether there is any implied warranty about the safe port.\\nThe effect of the safe port warranty is that the ship can refuse to proceed to the port nominated without being in breach of the charter unless the warranty is satisfied. Futhermore, if the ship reasonably complies with the order and proceeds to port, the charterer is liable for any damage sustained. The crucial time for determining whether a port is safe is the time it is named by the charterer. The safe port warranty is inapplicable if it becomes unsafe after the arrival of the vessel. However, if the port becomes unsafe after its nomination, it is the responsibility of the charterer to substitute another port if it is reasonable under the circumstance."}]},"fpage":"433","lpage":"453","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.3.433","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.3.009","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001483527","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"09","volume":"26","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001483526","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub85c\ud14c\ub974\ub2f4 \uaddc\uce59\uc0c1 \uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc640 \ud788\ub9d0\ub77c\uc57c \uc870\ud56d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Performing Party and Himalaya Clauses under the Rotterdam Rules"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Performing Party and Himalaya Clauses under the Rotterdam Rules"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc591\uc815\ud638(\uc0c1\uc9c0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\uae38\uc0c1(\uc0c1\uc9c0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc640 \ud574\uc0c1\uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\ub150\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ub85c\ud14c\ub974\ub2f4 \uaddc\uce59\uc0c1 \ucc45\uc784\uc758 \uc8fc\uccb4, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc758 \ucc45\uc784\ubc94\uc704 \ubc0f \ud788\ub9d0\ub77c\uc57c\uc870\ud56d\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\ubc94\uc704\uc640 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \uad00\ud558\uc5ec \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub85c\ud14c\ub974\ub2f4 \uaddc\uce59\uc0c1 \uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub294 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d\uc0c1 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc758 \uc758\ubb34\ub97c \uc2e4\ud589\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uadf8 \uc2e4\ud589\uc744 \uc778\uc218\ud55c \uc774\ud589\ubcf4\uc870\uc790\ub85c\uc11c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc740 \uc774\ub4e4 \uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc758 \uc791\uc704 \ub610\ub294 \ubd80\uc791\uc704\ub85c \uc778\ud55c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uacc4\uc57d\uc0c1 \uc758\ubb34\uc758 \uc704\ubc18\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubd80\ub2f4\ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ud574\uc0c1\uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub294 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc5d0 \uc900\ud558\ub294 \uad8c\ub9ac\xb7\uc758\ubb34 \ub0b4\uc9c0 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubd80\ub2f4\ud55c\ub2e4.\\n\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uacfc \ud574\uc0c1\uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub294 \ubd88\ubc95\ud589\uc704\ucc45\uc784\uc774\ub098 \uae30\ud0c0\uc758 \uccad\uad6c\uc6d0\uc778\uc744 \uae30\ucd08\ub85c \uc18c\uc1a1\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc870\uc57d\uc0c1 \ud56d\ubcc0\uc774\ub098 \ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc870\uc57d\uc0c1 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubd80\ub2f4\ud558\uc9c0 \uc544\ub2c8\ud558\ub294 \uc774\ud589\ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub098 \uae30\ud0c0 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc758 \ud53c\uc6a9\uc790\ub97c \uc0c1\ub300\ub85c \uc9c1\uc811 \uc18c\uc1a1\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub41c \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc774\ub4e4 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\ub3c4 \ubc95\uc815 \ud788\ub9d0\ub77c\uc57c\uc870\ud56d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud574 \uc870\uc57d\uc0c1 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc774 \ub204\ub9ac\ub294 \ud56d\ubcc0\uacfc \ucc45\uc784\uc81c\ud55c\uc744 \uc8fc\uc7a5\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub85c\ud14c\ub974\ub2f4 \uaddc\uce59\uc0c1 \ubc95\uc815 \ud788\ub9d0\ub77c\uc57c\uc870\ud56d\uc740 \uc774\ub97c \uc6d0\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub2f9\uc0ac\uc790\uc758 \ubc94\uc704\uc640 \uc694\uac74\uc744 \uad6c\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uace0, \ud574\uc11d\uc0c1 \uc624\ud574\uc758 \uc18c\uc9c0\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uc6a9\uc5b4\ub97c \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud788\ub9d0\ub77c\uc57c\uc870\ud56d\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\ubc94\uc704\ub098 \uc720\ud6a8\uc131\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud55c \ubc95\uc801 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc744 \uc904\uc774\uace0\uc790 \ub178\ub825\ud588\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uc758\uc758\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study examined principal actors of liability, vicarious liability of the carrier, the scope of application and the effects of statutory himalaya clause under the Rotterdam Rules.

The research results may be summarized as follows. Firstly, Incheon new port in Metropolitan Area should be constructed in early stage. Also systematic approach to forecast yearly cargo of Incheon new Port was prerequisite to perform its speedy construction. Secondly, it is required to ensure a brand equity which was a significant element having an influence on port competitiveness.\\nRPPM(Rotterdam Port Promotion council) is a splendid example for port organization to ensure a brand equity such as inviting the foreign shippers and residing a logistics exhibition on a regular basis.\\nThirdly, as a practical survey result was seen, it needed to retain operation capability to respond customer\'s needs to be included a main trunk line.

As a result, it is preferable to introduce a co-managed and non-profit insurance system initiated by the Korean government."}]},"fpage":"171","lpage":"189","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.1.171","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.1.005","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001436257","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"03","volume":"26","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001436254","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc0c1\ubcf4\ud5d8\uacc4\uc57d\ubc95\uc0c1 \ub2f4\ubcf4\ubc95\ub9ac\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654 \ub3d9\ud5a5 - MIA\uc0c1\uc758 \ub2f4\ubcf4\ubc95\ub9ac\uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c -"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Development of Warranty Doctrine in Marine Insurance Contract Law - Focusing on developing trends of \u201cwarranty doctrine\\" under MIA -"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Development of Warranty Doctrine in Marine Insurance Contract Law - Focusing on developing trends of \u201cwarranty doctrine\\" under MIA -"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uc120\uc625(\ucc3d\uc6d0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uc740\uc12d(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"18\uc138\uae30\uc5d0 \ud615\uc131\ub41c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uac04\uc8fc\ub418\ub294 \ub2f4\ubcf4\ubc95\ub9ac\uc758 \uc5c4\uaca9\uc131\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ubd80\uc7ac\uc640 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \ud53c\ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc758\uc874\ub3c4\uac00 \ub192\uc558\ub358 \uc2dc\ub300\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0ac\ud589\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\ud5d8 \uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubc29\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \ud55c\ud3b8\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc778\uc218\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \uc81c\ud55c\ud558\uace0 \ud55c\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc758 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uc544\uc8fc \uc720\uc6a9\ud55c \uae30\ub2a5\uc744 \ud558\uc5ec \uc654\ub2e4. \uc774\ucc98\ub7fc \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc815\ud655\ud558\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uae30 \uc5b4\ub824\uc6b4 \uc5f4\uc545\ud55c \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc778\uc218\ud658\uacbd\uc744 \ubc30\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ud615\uc131\xb7\uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc628 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \ub2f4\ubcf4\ubc95\ub9ac\ub294 200\uc5ec\ub144\uc774 \uc9c0\ub09c \uc815\ubcf4\ud1b5\uc2e0\uc2dc\ub300\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ubcf4\ud5d8\uacc4\uc57d\uc790\uc5d0\uac8c \uac00\ud639\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \ube44\ud310\uc774 \uc81c\uae30\ub418\uba74\uc11c \uc2e4\ubb34\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uadf8 \ubcc0\ud654\uc758 \uc694\uad6c\ub97c \ubc18\uc601\ud558\uae30\ub3c4 \ud558\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc774 \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2f4\ubcf4\ubc95\ub9ac\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc8fc\uc694\ud55c \uc7c1\uc810\uc5d0 \ub193\uc5ec\uc788\ub294 \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \ud574\uc11d\uc758 \uc644\ud654\uc774\ub2e4. \uc989, \uacc4\uc57d\uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud569\ub9ac\uc131\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc190\ud574\uc640 \ub2f4\ubcf4\uc704\ubc18 \uac04\uc5d0 \uc778\uacfc\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uc694\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub2f4\ubcf4\ucda9\uc871\uc744 \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\ucc45\uc784\uac1c\uc2dc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\uc81c\uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc815\ud558\uae30 \ubcf4\ub2e4\ub294 \uacc4\uc57d\uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \uc57d\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \ubcf4\ud5d8\uc790\uc758 \ubcf4\ud5d8\uae08\uc9c0\uae09\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc815\uc9c0\uc870\uac74\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \ud604\ub300\ud654\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc751\ud558\ub294 \ub2f4\ubcf4\ubc95\ub9ac\ub97c \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc790\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\ud654\ub294 \ud574\uc0c1\ubcf4\ud5d8\ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c \uad6d\uc81c\uc801\uc778 \uacf5\ud1b5\uaddc\ubc94\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uc628 MIA\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uac1c\uc815\uc744 \uc694\uad6c\ud558\ub294 \uc6d0\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper reviews recent trend in addressing the controversial issues of the interpretation and application of the warranty doctrine in marine insurance contracts. The breach of warranty discharges the insurers from further liability since the breach is committed because compliance with the warranty is a condition precedent to the liability of the insurer. The primary purpose of the warranty in marine insurance was to limit risks against navigational hazard and to prevent fraudulent contract.\\nHowever, it is requested for the warranty doctrine to be reformed since the literally strict compliance with the warranty would create unfair and unreasonable relationship of the concerned parties of the insurance contract. The direction of the marine insurance law reform is to require the causation between the breach of warranty and the resulted loss for the insurer to be free from liability. The other view for amelioration of the strictness of the warranty doctrine is that warranty can be construed as a condition precedent to payment of a particular claim rather than a condition precedent to liability under the whole policy."}]},"fpage":"145","lpage":"169","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.1.145","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.1.006","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001436254","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"03","volume":"26","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001436251","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"YAR\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\uc218\uc870\ud56d\uc758 \uae30\ubcf8\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Fundamental Problems of Salvage Remuneration Clause under the YAR"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Fundamental Problems of Salvage Remuneration Clause under the YAR"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ud55c\ub099\ud604(\uacbd\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 1974\ub144-2004\ub144 YAR\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\uc218\uc640 \ud658\uacbd\uc190\ud574\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uba70, \ub85c\uc774\uc988\uad6c\uc870\uacc4\uc57d\ud45c\uc900\uc11c\uc2dd(LOF) \ub610\ub294 \uadf8\uac83\uacfc \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \uad6c\uc870\uacc4\uc57d\uc11c\uc2dd\uc0c1 \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacf5\ub3d9\ud574\uc190\uc0c1\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uc601\uad6d\ubc95 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\uc218\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c YAR\uc0c1\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc740 \uc81c3\uc758 \uc2dc\ub300\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uae30\ubcf8\uc801 \ubb38\uc81c\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc2e4\ubb34\uc790\ub294 1974\ub144 YAR(1990\ub144 \uac1c\uc815), 1994\ub144\xb72004\ub144 YAR\uc744 \ubaa8\ub450 \ud604\ud589\uaddc\uce59\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \ub610\ud55c LOF\ud615 \uad6c\uc870\ubcf4\uc218\ub97c \uacf5\ub3d9\ud574\uc190\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uaddc\uc815\uacfc \uc778\uc815\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \uaddc\uc815\uc774 \ubcd1\uc874\ud558\ub294 \ud1b5\uc77c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uad6c\uc870\uac00 \ub0a8\uc544 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 2004\ub144 YAR\uc740 \uc120\uc8fc\ub2e8\uccb4\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc9c0\uc9c0\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uc0c1\ud0dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucc44\ud0dd\ub41c \uc720\uc77c\ud55c YAR\uc774\ubbc0\ub85c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ucc44\ud0dd\ub420 \uc804\ub9dd\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uace0 \ubcfc \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubd88\ud1b5\uc77c\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub294 \uc27d\uac8c \ud574\uc18c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc81c3\uc758 \uc2dc\ub300\uc5d0\ub294 \uacf5\ub3d9\ud574\uc190\ud589\uc704\uc758 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801 \uacb0\uacfc\ub85c\uc11c \ub610\ub294 \uadf8\uac83\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \uc720\ub958\uc624\uc5fc\uc190\ud574, \ub354\uc6b1\uc774 \ud658\uacbd\uc190\ud574\ub77c\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb38\uc81c\uac00 \ud574\ub09c\uad6c\uc870\uacc4\uc57d\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\ub85c YAR\uc5d0 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uac8c \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this work aims to analyse the fundamental problems on salvage remuneration and environmental damage under the 1974-2004 YAR.

Under LOF salvage remuneration type, it remains that is not a unified composition owing to coexisting of the rule is recognized as general average and do not recognize this. Moreover, because the YAR 2004 is only YAR that is adopted in the absence of support from the shipowner groups, it seems to no future prospects to be adopted.

The result of analysis can be summarized as follows.\\nFirst of all, the ratio of the value added amount in Logistics industry to the whole industry in Korea has been continuously decreased to 3.8% in 2007 from 7.4% in 1985. It means that the domestic intermediate input of Logistics industry is very important in the economic growth of Korea. Second, the most part of the value added-inducement effects in Logistics industry are attributed to fulfil the consumption and export demand in this industry. Third, the coefficient of value added-inducement resulted from the final demand in this industry is gradually decreasing year by year. To resolve these problems, We need the industrial policies like these; 1) to widen the domestic market demand of Logistics industry; 2) to improve the value added in this industry, in short, to increase the share of domestic production of core parts, 3) to decrease the import-inducement effect of major export-driven manufacturing industries.\\nIn conclusion, for the development and sustainable growth of the Korean logistics industry, it is required to enlarge the economies of scale and scope in this industry. Especially, We should be able to promote the logistics-related global-sized domestic firms (e.g., such as FedEx and TNT, etc.)"}]},"fpage":"87","lpage":"114","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.1.87","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.1.001","citation-count":"21","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001436250","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2010","pub-mon":"03","volume":"26","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001436245","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\xb7\ubbf8 \ubb34\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870 \uc720\ud615\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ub300\ubbf8 \uc218\ucd9c\ud654\ubb3c \ubb3c\ub958\ud328\ud134 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analyze the Logistics Pattern of Regional and Port Export Freight Generation between Korea and the United States"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analyze the Logistics Pattern of Regional and Port Export Freight Generation between Korea and the United States"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uc5b8\uacbd(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0 )","\ubc31\uc885\uc2e4(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc7a5\uc9c0\uc120(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0 )"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc758 \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \ub300\ubbf8\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud655\ub300\uac00 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uad50\uc6b0\uc704 \ud488\ubaa9\uad70\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4\xb7\ud56d\ub9cc\ubcc4 \ubb3c\ub958\ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub300\ubbf8\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c\uc2dc\uc7a5 \ud655\ub300\uac00 \uc608\uc0c1\ub418\ub294 \ube44\uad50\uc6b0\uc704 \ud488\ubaa9\uad70\uc740 \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc720\ud615\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ucd94\ucd9c\ub41c 7\uac00\uc9c0 \ud55c\ubbf8\ubb34\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870 \uc720\ud615\uc744 \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uc694\uc18c\u2015\ubb34\uc5ed\ud2b9\ud654\uc9c0\uc218, \ube44\uad50\uc6b0\uc704\ub3c4 \uce21\uc815\uac12, \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc810\uc720\uc728\xb7\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc131\uc7a5\ub960 \ubcc0\ud654\u2015\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131\ud654\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c \uc81c\uc548\ud55c \uc720\ud615\ud654 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc740 \ub300\ubbf8\xb7\ub300\uc138\uacc4 5\ub144\uac04(2004\u223c2008\ub144) \ubb34\uc5ed\ud2b9\ud654\uc9c0\uc218 \uac12\uc744 Ward \uad70\uc9d1\ubc29\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8\ub8f9\ud654\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc124\uacb0\uacfc \ub300\ubbf8\uad6d \uc218\ucd9c \ube44\uad50\uc6b0\uc704 \ud488\ubaa9\uad70\uc778 ICT(Informatin and Communication Technology), \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28, \ubc31\uc0c9\uac00\uc804, \uc11d\uc720\uc870\uc81c\ud488 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4\u2024\ud56d\ub9cc\ubcc4 \ubb3c\ub958\ud2b9\uc131\uc740 \ub2e4\uc591\ud558\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc815\ucc45\uc785\uc548\uc790\uac00 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\xb7\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\uad6d\ubcc4 \ubb34\uc5ed\ud328\ud134 \ubc0f \ud488\ubaa9\ubcc4 \ubb3c\ub958\ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud568\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper aims to analyze the logistics pattern of regional and port export freight generation by using key products in order to increase the size of exports to the United States.

S. stock price. Second, such explanatory variables, with highly significance level, were shown to affect the BDI positively, negatively and positively, respectively. Third, due to the global finance-crisis, the impacts of eurodollar interest rate and U. S. stock price on the BDI were found to be increased while the latter was more influential. Fourth, the impact of China\'s iron import was still important to the BDI, although its magnitude was slightly reduced compared to the estimation result without the global finance-crisis. Fifth, using the error correction model in the form of ARDL, the error correction term was found to be negative significantly, indicating the presence of cointegration relationship indirectly. Finally, through the various tests, the estimating residual were found to be normally distributed and non serially correlated with no functional misspecification. Also we confirmed the stability of the coefficients using the CUSUM test."}]},"fpage":"1","lpage":"16","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2010.26.1.1","uci":"G704-000463.2010.26.1.003","citation-count":"14","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001436233","verified":"Y"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"12","volume":"25","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001407372","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801 \uc131\uc7a5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\uacfc\uc81c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Policy measures of Sustainable growth for Shipping Industry"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Policy measures of Sustainable growth for Shipping Industry"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud558\uc601\uc11d(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ud55c\uc885\uae38(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uae08\ubc88\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\ubd88\ud669\uc740 \uc288\ud37c\uc0ac\uc774\ud074\uc774\ub77c\uace0 \ubd88\ub9ac\ub294 \ud638\ud669\uc774 \ube44\uad50\uc801 \uc7a5\uae30\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc9c0\uc18d\ub418\ub2e4\uac00 \uc138\uacc4\uc801 \uae08\uc735\uc704\uae30\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uacf5\uae09\uacfc \uc218\uc694\uac00 \ubaa8\ub450 \uc704\ucd95\ub418\ub294 \uacb0\uacfc\uc5d0 \uae30\uc778\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ud55c\uad6d\uc815\ubd80\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc815\ucc45\uc744 \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud558\uc5ec \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubc0f \ud574\uc6b4\uacfc \ubc00\uc811\ud55c \uad00\ub828\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc758 \uc704\uae30\uadf9\ubcf5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ub178\ub825\uc744 \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ud558\uc9c0\ub9cc \ubcf4\ub2e4 \uadfc\ubcf8\uc801\uc778 \ucc98\ubc29\uc774 \ub9c8\ub828\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\uba74 \uc704\uae30\ub294 \ubc18\ubcf5\ub420 \uc218\ubc16\uc5d0 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \ud604 \uc704\uae30\uc0c1\ud669\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc6b4\uc5c5\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc131\uc7a5\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ub9c8\ub828\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc815\ucc45\ub300\uc548\uc744 \ub2e8\uae30 \ubc0f \uc911\uc7a5\uae30\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ub2e8\uae30\uc815\ucc45\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\ub9e4\uc785\ud504\ub85c\uadf8\ub7a8\uc758 \ud655\ub300, \uc120\ud654\uc8fc \uc0c1\uc0dd\uae30\ubc18 \uac15\ud654, \ud2b9\ubcc4\ubc95 \uc81c\uc815\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc911\uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc778 \uc815\ucc45\uacfc\uc81c\ub85c\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735\uae30\uad00\uc758 \uac15\ud654, \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc0ac\uc5c5\ub2e4\uac01\ud654, \uc120\uc8fc\uc0ac-\uc6b4\ud56d\uc0ac \ubd84\ub9ac\uccb4\uc81c \ub3c4\uc785\uc744 \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Current recession of shipping industry is caused by end of a boom that results from world financial crisis.

So, it is necessary to prepare the device that a person who control electronic message instead of physical possession of original document can exercise or transfer his right.

Second, domestic final demand and export demand play key roles on the growth of the gross output among the major factors. \\nIn conclusion, final demand and export demand have an important and major impact on the growth of gross output. Therefore, for the development and sustainable growth of the Korean logistics industry, it is required to enlarge the economies of scale and scope in this industry.

The decrease in boarding rate is based on the lessening demand for passengers. This lessening demand is being driven by the decline in population of many of the Islands, who\'s decreasing desirability serves to fuel this industry. The small companies have many challenges to overcome and are slow to improve services. Frequent service cancellations, aging sailors and an increasing deficit in ship service are major factors. Therefore, there is a need to build better suited routes as well as to reorganize the main shipping operators.\\nThis study surveyed criterions and alternatives for the choice of main operator when we make the best suited route and suggested methods of the choice for effective operator through analysis of survey. The best factor in choice of Operation company is publicity first, secondly professionalism and comes the satisfaction of service, economic feasibility in that order."}]},"fpage":"889","lpage":"907","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.4.889","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.4.007","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001407331","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"12","volume":"25","issue":"4"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001407277","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud37c\uc9c0\ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc \ubd84\ub958\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Systematic Classification of Container Ports in China using the Fuzzy Clustering Method"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Systematic Classification of Container Ports in China using the Fuzzy Clustering Method"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \uae09\uc131\uc7a5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec FCM(Fuzzy C-Mean)\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud56d\ub9cc\uc744 \uadf8\ub8f9\ubcc4\ub85c \ubb36\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uadf8\ub8f9\ubcc4 \ube44\uad50\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud574 \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \ucd1d 5\uac1c\uc758 \uad70\uc9d1\uc73c\ub85c \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\ub9c1 \ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ubd84\uc11d\ub300\uc0c1 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uacc4\uce35 1(B \uad70\uc9d1)\uc5d0 \uc0c1\ud558\uc774\ud56d\ub9cc, \uacc4\uce35 2\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ud6c4\ubcf4\uad70 \uad70\uc9d1(E \uad70\uc9d1)\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ud64d\ucf69, \uc120\uc804\ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \ubd84\ub958\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ud55c\ud3b8, \ucd5c\uadfc \uae09\uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uad11\uc800\uc6b0, \ub2dd\ubcf4, \uce6d\ub2e4\uc624\ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uacc4\uce35 3\uc758 \uad70\uc9d1(D \uad70\uc9d1)\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\ub958\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uacc4\uce35 2\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \ucd94\uaca9\ud558\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ub2e4\uc18c \ubb34\ub9ac\uac00 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \uacc4\uce35 4\uc758 \uad70\uc9d1\uc5d0\ub294 \uae09\uaca9\ud55c \uc2e0\uc7a5\uc138\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \uc0e4\uba3c\ud56d\uacfc \ub2e4\ub844\ud56d\uc774 \ud3ec\ud568\ub418\uba70, \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub0ae\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uac16\ucd98 \uacc4\uce35 5\uc758 \uad70\uc9d1(A \uad70\uc9d1)\uc5d0\ub294 \ub80c\uc708\uac15, \uc60c\ud0c0\uc774, \uc789\ucee4\uc6b0, \ud0c0\uc774\ucc3d\uc2a4 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \uc18d\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ud655\uc7a5\uc5f0\uad6c \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc, \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \ub6f0\uc5b4\ub09c \uc0c1\uc704 3\uac1c \uacc4\uce35\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc0b0, \uce74\uc624\uc29d \ud56d\ub9cc\uc744 \uc81c\uc678\ud55c \ubaa8\ub4e0 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ucc44\uc6cc\uc9c0\ub294 \ud604\uc0c1\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600\ub0c8\uc73c\uba70, \ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8\ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub0ae\uc740 \uacc4\uce35 4\uc640 \uacc4\uce35 5\uc640 \uc8fc\ub85c \uc704\uce58\ud568\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ud558\ud5a5\uc870\uc815 \ucd94\uc138\ub97c \uac80\uc99d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this research is to classify the container ports of Chinese and Northeast Asia which marked as World Top 100 in terms of container handling volume using well established methodology, FCM(Fuzzy C-Mean).

In the thesis, opportunity cost means dispatch cost and demurrage cost. P Iron and steel company transports coal and iron from over sea port and it is important to reduce the sea transport cost between loading port and unloading port Pohang and Gwangyang. P Iron and steel company increases the number of large ship while ship scheduling. But it causes to increase berth congestion at the specific water depth berth owing to the draught of large ship. Demurrage cost at port increases proportion to the ship\'s sojourn time at port and its cost of big size ship is much bigger than that of small size ship. So to reduce the sojourn time and keep equilibrium of berth occupation, P iron and steel company enforce shifting strategy between berth.

Thus, terminal service managers are recommended to devise operations and marketing strategies that focus on the dominant service quality dimensions in order to enhance customer satisfaction and, in turn, foster positive behavior intention."}]},"fpage":"717","lpage":"739","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.3.717","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.3.011","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001383607","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"09","volume":"25","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001383604","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \ubb3c\ub958\ud658\uacbd \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc218\ub3c4\uad8c\ud56d \ubc0f \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on The Container Port Strategy of Metropolitan Port and Busan Port Based on The Logistics Environmental Changes of North East Asia"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on The Container Port Strategy of Metropolitan Port and Busan Port Based on The Logistics Environmental Changes of North East Asia"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc870\uc9c4\ud589(\ud55c\ub77c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 2002\ub144\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc138\uacc4 3\uc704\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 1\uc704\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098, \uc911\uad6d\ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc758 \uacbd\uc774\uc801\uc778 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc131\uc7a5\uc138\uc5d0 \ubc00\ub824 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uc704\uc0c1\uc774 \uae09\uaca9\ud788 \uc57d\ud654\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubd81\uc911\uad6d 3\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc(\uc0c1\ud558\uc774 \uc774\ubd81 \ubd81\uc911\uad6d 4\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc)\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc18c\uacc4\ub294 2011\ub144\uc5d0\ub294 3879\ub9cc(8582\ub9cc)TEU\ub85c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d 1577\ub9ccTEU\uc758 2.5\ubc30(5.4\ubc30) \uc218\uc900, 2015\ub144\uc5d0\ub294 7645\ub9cc(1\uc5b57045\ub9cc)TEU\ub85c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d 2008\ub9ccTEU\uc758 3.8\ubc30(8.5\ubc30) \uc218\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ub208\ub369\uc774\ucc98\ub7fc \ubd88\uc5b4\ub0a0 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc608\uc0c1\ub428\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \ud5c8\ube0c\ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uc0c1\ud574\ud56d\uc73c\ub85c \uadc0\uacb0\ub420 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \\n\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \ud574\uc6b4\ud56d\ub9cc\uc9c8\uc11c \uc7ac\ud3b8 \uc804\ub9dd\uc5d0 \ub530\ub77c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc218\ub3c4\uad8c\ud56d \ubc0f \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud56d\ub9cc \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc218\ub9bd\ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 BCG \ub9e4\ud2b8\ub9ad\uc2a4 \uae30\ubc95 \ubc0f O/D \ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uacb0\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc815\ucc45\uc758 \uadfc\uac04\uc778 \uc9c0\uae08\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \u5169\u6e2f\u9ad4\u5236(Two Port System)\uc5d0\uc11c \u4e09\u6e2f\u9ad4\u5236(Three Port System) \ub610\ub294 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d/\uc218\ub3c4\uad8c\ud56d\uc758 \uc591\ud56d\uccb4\uc81c\ub85c \uc804\ud658\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Busan Port was ranked the first port in North East Asia in 2002, and has been losing it\'s competitive position due to the rush of the Northern Chinese Ports with the remarkably high rate of container throughput volume-over 25% of annual average rate of growth.

All series span the period January 1999 to May 2009. I first show that both the series and the residuals are stationary at the 5 percent significance level. I hitherto make use of historical decompositions and impulse response functions, both of which have now been widely used to examine how much movement in one variable can be explained by innovations in different variables and how rapidly these fluctuations in one variable can be transmitted to another. The historical decompositions for the import container volume show that the exchange rate moves closer to the actual import volume than the business activity, indicating the exchange rate outperforms the business in forecasting the import container volume. The impulse responses indicate that container volumes to the shocks in exchange rate dampen very slowly to its pre-shock level, while container volumes respond positively to the shocks in the business activity and disappear very slowly. The accumulative response to the exchange rate increase of 30 won per dollar is the reduction of 231 thousand TEU, and the accumulative response to the 5 point industrial production increase is the increase of 404 thousand TEU in Busan port. This increase amounts to the 4.5% of the total import volume of Busan port in 2008. The accumulative responses of Incheon and Gwangyang are the increase of 49 thousand TEU and 14 thousand TEU, representing 5.6% and 1.8% of its total import volume, respectively."}]},"fpage":"621","lpage":"637","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.3.621","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.3.002","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001383592","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"09","volume":"25","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001383588","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4\uc758 \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \uac1c\ubc1c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Development of Online Reference Model for the Management of Port and Logistics Information Standards"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Development of Online Reference Model for the Management of Port and Logistics Information Standards"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc870\uc7ac\ud615(\ubd80\uc0b0\uc678\uad6d\uc5b4\ub300\ud559\uad50","\ud2b9\uc131\ud654\uad50\uc721\uc6d0)","\ucd5c\ud615\ub9bc(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ucc3d\uc12d(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc15\uc6a9\uc131(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50","\uacbd\uc601\uc815\ubcf4\ud559\uacfc)","\uad8c\ud0dc\uc6b0(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc8fc\uc774\ub3c8(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50 \ub300\ud559\uc6d0 \uacbd\uc601\uc815\ubcf4\ud559\uacfc \ubc15\uc0ac\uacfc\uc815)","\uae40\ud55c\uc218(\ubd80\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50","\ucef4\ud4e8\ud130 \uba40\ud2f0\ubbf8\ub514\uc5b4 \uacf5\ud559\ubd80 \ubc15\uc0ac\uacfc\uc815)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4 \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \uad00\ub9ac\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uac1c\ubc1c\ud558\ub294\ub370 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ubaa8\ub378\uc740 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud45c\uc900\uc744 \uc27d\uac8c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uace0, \uad00\ub9ac\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790-\ubb38\uc11c-\ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4\uc758 3\uacc4\uce35\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4 \ud45c\uc900\ud654 \ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uc815\ubcf4\uae30\uc220 \uc544\ud0a4\ud14d\ucc98(ITA)\uc758 \uae30\uc220\ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378(Technical Reference Model)\uc744 \uc751\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec, \ubcf8 \ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\uc790, \uc218\ucd9c\uc785 \uc5c5\ubb34 \ud504\ub85c\uc138\uc2a4, \uc218\ucd9c\uc785 \uc2e0\uace0\ubb38\uc11c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ud558\uace0 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc815\uc758\ub41c \uc138 \uac00\uc9c0 \uac1d\uccb4(object)\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud569 \uc800\uc7a5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc628\ud1a8\ub85c\uc9c0(Ontology)\uae30\ubc18\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc800\uc7a5\uc18c\ub97c \uc124\uacc4\u2024\uad6c\ud604\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc628\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud56d\ub9cc \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4 \ud45c\uc900\uc758 \uc800\uc7a5, \uac80\uc0c9, \uac00\uacf5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ub378\ud30c\uc774 \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud45c\uc900 \uc804\ubb38\uac00\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubcf8 \ucc38\uc870\ubaa8\ub378\uc758 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ud568\uaed8 \uc870\uc0ac\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to develop an online reference model for the management of port and logistics information standards.

Finally, on the national level, the benefit and cost of tonnage tax system was calculated by using Input-Output Table. \\nThe results reveal that Korea\'s tonnage tax system has produced at least 4 times benefits than cost since 2005, when it was introduced. So, the author concluded that the tonnage tax system is necessary for Korea\'s shipping industry to continuously develop without any economic loss and furthermore it should be improved, for example, by eliminating the so-called elapsed-time clause, which states that the tonnage tax system will be abolished from 2015."}]},"fpage":"565","lpage":"596","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.3.565","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.3.003","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001383564","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"09","volume":"25","issue":"3"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001383559","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Liability for Improper Stowage under Charterparties"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"\uc6a9\uc120\uacc4\uc57d\ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc801\ubd80\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ucc45\uc784"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Liability for Improper Stowage under Charterparties"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc120\uc625(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"This article treats the liability for damages caused by improper stowage under the charter party, as well as the losses arising from the negligence of stevedores and the settlement of the damage to third parties under the Inter-Club Agreement of 1996.\\nVoyage and time charter parties generally have specified provisions dealing with the cost, responsibility, or both, for loading, stowage, discharging and stevedores, for the clarification of the general provisions of the governing law.

The aims of this research are to get the influencing factors of the collaboration, analyse causal link between the factors and the collaboration, and confirm an influence both the collaboration and performance.\\nThe methodologies of this research used three kinds that one verified a validity through an exploratory and a confirmatory factor analysis, another analysed a reliability through cronbach alpha coefficient, and the third confirmed a causal link between independent variables, parameter and dependent variables through structural equation modeling analysis. The results of this research are as follows.\\nFirst, logistics information system had an influence on supply chain collaboration by providing the foundation for the system utilization in international logistics process.\\nSecond, this research have convinced itself that it can recognize the importance of managers in the effecting collaboration in logistics process. Managers spread a cooperative attitude between the staff, therefore, they could play roles in fostering the collaboration.\\nThird, formalization was found to be a positive effect to the collaboration. The effect is an opposite concerning with hypotheses because shipping and logistics firms should work through the contract with customer as shipper. Hence, formalization influence positively to the collaboration because they are working through a formal rules and process. On the other side, centralization has an negative influence on the collaboration and reward system influence positively to the collaboration.\\nForth, supply chain collaboration significantly influences performance, which implies that firms could promote cooperation and collaboration across internal and external process of a firm to achieve performance as the logistical effectiveness and efficiency."}]},"fpage":"411","lpage":"442","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.2.411","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.2.004","citation-count":"16","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001362126","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"06","volume":"25","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001362121","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"BSC\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uac04 \uc81c\ud734\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on Performance of Alliance among Logistics Service Providers Using BSC"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on Performance of Alliance among Logistics Service Providers Using BSC"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uad8c\uc624\uacbd(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc29\ud76c\uc11d(\uc911\uc559\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \uc790\uc0ac\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654\ub97c \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uac04 \uc81c\ud734\ub97c \ud655\ub300\ud574 \ub098\uac00\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\ud734\uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc81c\ud734\uc131\uacfc\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uae30\ubc95\uc73c\ub85c BSC(Balanced Score Card : \uade0\ud615\uc131\uacfc\ud45c)\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

The port congestions have close connection with this profitability and must be solved to strengthen national logistic competitive advantage. These congestions result from a variety of reasons and the representative reason is shortage of port facilities. From time to time, other seasonal reasons and climate reasons such as bad weather result in these congestion. Each nation including Korea has enhanced the efficiency of port operation by extending port profitability and automating the cargo handling to decrease the congestions in their ports. \\nThis paper deals with the bulk ship\'s congestion in Korean ports and empirical study is undergone by T-test and ANOVA in view of ship\'s capacity, port type, port location and visiting time, cargo volume. The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the decrease of the congestion by analysing the factor on the congestion in ports in Korea"}]},"fpage":"263","lpage":"284","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.2.263","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.2.003","citation-count":"10","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001362095","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"06","volume":"25","issue":"2"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001362089","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc608\uc120\uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \uadfc\ub85c\uad00\uacc4\ubc95\uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A study on Seaman Labor Relations of harbor tug boat"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A study on Seaman Labor Relations of harbor tug boat"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc804\uc900\uc218(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc30\ub3d9\uc9c4(\uc11c\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc \uc608\uc120\uc740 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0 \uc785\ucd9c\ud56d\ud558\ub294 \uc678\ud56d\uc120\uc5d0 \uc548\uc804\ud55c \uc774\uc811\uc548\uc744 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc548\uc804\uc131\uc744 \ub192\uc774\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ubb3c\ub958\uc758 95%\uac00 \ud574\uc0c1 \uc218\uc1a1\uc5d0 \uc758\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ub9cc\ud07c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc608\uc120\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc6b4\uc601\uc740 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc911\uc694\ud558\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uadfc\ub798 \uad6d\ud1a0\ud574\uc591\ubd80\uac00 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc608\uc120\uc758 \uc120\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc740 \uadfc\ub85c\uae30\uc900\ubc95\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ub41c\ub2e4\uace0 \uc120\uc6d0\ubc95 \uc81c2\uc870\ub97c \uc720\uad8c \ud574\uc11d\ud568\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \ud63c\ub780\uc744 \uc57c\uae30\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc608\uc120\uc120\uc6d0\ub4e4\uc758 \uadfc\ub85c \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc0b4\ud53c\uace0 \uc720\uad8c\ud574\uc11d\uc758 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc5ec\ubd80\ub97c \uac80\ud1a0\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ubc95\uc801\uc6a9\uc740 \uc120\uc6d0\ubc95\uc744 \uadfc\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\ub418 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc608\uc120 \uc120\uc6d0\uc758 \uadfc\ub85c\ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \uc0b4\ub824 \ub300\ucc45\uc744 \uac15\uad6c\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ub428\uc744 \uc54c \uc218 \uc788\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Harbor tugs assist ocean going vessels\' maneuvering at port safely and efficiently.

For over 30 years, Crews on tug boats have been supervised according to the act of seaman by the regional maritime authorities. \\nRecently, the ministry of land, transport and maritime affairs in Korea made an authoritative interpretation that the harbor tug boat do not come under the Seaman\'s Act therefore crews on harbor tugs must be controlled under the Labor Standard Act. This interpretation has not only brought confusions to the owners of tugs and the regional port offices but also the unions of seaman. \\nThe Seaman\'s Act is a hybrid law of two important concepts which are to set the standards for the conditions of seaman\'s labor as well as to set the standards of the safety of maritime livings at sea.

Under this background, this paper analysed the economic effects of tonnage tax system for 3 years from 2005 to 2007. Tax reduction for these 3 years amounts to 713b won, which was invested into new shipbuilding and second vessels. Total ship investment including financed fund derived from the investment by tax reduction amounts to 3,565b won. Total vessel scale accounted for 5,451,000DWT. Operating profit from the invested vessels amounts to 277b won, employment and wages effect for seamen amounts to 5,685 persons and 224b won. Employment and wages effect in maritime industry which includes shipbuilding, ship inspection, ship assurance amounts to 6,196 persons and 884b won.

In conclusion he represented the fertile soil and the suitable place to trade as the most important 2 factors in something beneficial for people to live. \\nThe author of TAEKRIJI revealed that it might be indispensable for people to use the ship for transporting the mass volume of merchandise and to make use of geographical advantage to combine oversea and river shipping and to lay stress on international trade than domestic trade for getting commercial interests from trade. \\nLEE Joong-hwan\'s economic views on trade and logistics might affect the later scholars such as HONG Dae-yong, PARK Ji-won and BAK JE-gha to form the similar views on shipping, transportation and trade."}]},"fpage":"167","lpage":"184","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.1.167","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.1.007","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001330546","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"03","volume":"25","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001330544","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc \ub0b4 \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uac1c\ubc1c \ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis on the Marina Development in Port Area"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis on the Marina Development in Port Area"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc131\uadc0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \ub808\uc800 \ud56d\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0 \ud2b9\ud788 \uae30\uc874 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uac74\uc124\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4 \ubcf8 \ubc14, \uae30\uc874 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc2dc\uc124\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uac74\uc124\uc740 \ube44\uc6a9\uc744 \uac10\uc18c\uc2dc\ud0a4\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud6a8\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ubbfc\ub4e4\uc5d0\uac8c \uc8fc\ub294 \ub4f1 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc774\uc810\uc774 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uad6d, \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4 \ubcf8 \uacb0\uacfc \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uac1c\ubc1c \ucd08\uae30\uc5d0\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc \ub0b4 \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098\ub97c \uc870\uc131\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc95\uc81c\ub3c4\uc801 \uc7a5\uce58\uc758 \ub9c8\ub828\uacfc \uacf5\uacf5 \uc608\uc0b0 \uc9c0\uc6d0\ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \ud22c\uc790 \uc720\uc778 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\ub4e4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud56d\ub9cc \ub0b4 \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uac1c\ubc1c\uc774 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\uac8c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\ub3c4 \uc77c\ubcf8\uacfc \uac19\uc774 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc95 \ub4f1\uc5d0 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uac1c\ubc1c \uac00\ub2a5 \uc870\ud56d\uc744 \uc0bd\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uac01\uc885 \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098 \uacc4\ud68d\uc774 \ud56d\ub9cc \uacc4\ud68d\uc758 \uc77c\ubd80\ub85c\uc11c \uc218\uc6a9\ub418\uc5b4 \uccb4\uacc4\uc801 \uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \uac01\uc885 \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \uac00\ub2a5\ud1a0\ub85d \ud558\uc5ec\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc544\uc6b8\ub7ec \ub9c8\ub9ac\ub098\uac00 \uad6d\ubbfc \ub808\uc800\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \uc0ac\ud68c\uac04\uc811\uc790\ubcf8\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uace0\ub824\ud558\uc5ec \uac1c\ubc1c \uc2dc \uac01\uc885 \uc778\uc13c\ud2f0\ube0c\ub97c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In this study, the trend of leisure port development was analysed and the possibility to make a marina in port area was reviewed. A marina made in a port has many benefits such as reducing initial investment and user costs, revitalizing the local economy, improving aesthetic aspects in ports, etc. In the country case studies including USA and Japan, it is ascertained that in the initial stage of marina development, port authority had a major role in the supply of marinas using their budget and port facilities to meet the rising demand. In Korea, as much investment is necessary because of making large breakwaters or jetties to protect marina facilities from frequent typhoons, so port authority must have a similar role in the future to meet increasing demand for marina according to rising income. \\nFor this purpose, existing port law or related laws have to be revised to systematically plan, construct and operate a marina within a port system as in Japan. Through this measure, all marina plan in Korea can be implemented in a efficient way and be given various incentives from the port authority to impedite development within existing port areas. This will make marine leisure industry more promising than ever before."}]},"fpage":"145","lpage":"166","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.1.145","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.1.010","citation-count":"9","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001330544","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"03","volume":"25","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001330541","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc720\uce58\uc0b0\uc5c5 \ubd84\uc11d-\ud3ec\ud56d \uc601\uc77c\ub9cc\ud56d \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Inducement of Firms in Container Port Hinterland: A Case of Pohang-Youngil Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Inducement of Firms in Container Port Hinterland: A Case of Pohang-Youngil Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud558\uc601\uc11d(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc870\ud601\uc218(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud3ec\ud56d \uc601\uc77c\ub9cc\ud56d\uc740 \ub300\uad6c\u2024\uacbd\ubd81 \uc720\uc77c\uc758 \ud574\uc591\ud1b5\ub85c\uc778 \ub3d9\uc2dc\uc5d0 \uadf9\ub3d9\ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544 \ubc0f \uc77c\ubcf8\uc744 \uc5f0\uacb0\ud558\ub294 \ud658\ub3d9\ud574\uad8c \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\ud56d\ub9cc \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc900\ube44\ub97c \ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc601\uc77c\ub9cc\ud56d\uc740 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ucc3d\ucd9c\uc758 \uadfc\uac04\uc774 \ub418\ub294 \uad6c\ubbf8, \ub300\uad6c \ubc0f \ud3ec\ud56d\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5 \ub2e8\uc9c0\ub97c \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\ub098 \uc2e0\uaddc \uc9c0\uc5ed \ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uadf8 \uc778\uc9c0\ub3c4\uac00 \ub0ae\uc740 \ud3b8\uc774\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc601\uc77c\ub9cc\ud56d\uc740 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uacfc \uad11\uc591\ud56d \uac19\uc740 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uac70\uc810\ud56d\ub9cc\uc774 \uc544\ub2c8\ub77c, \uc9c0\uc5ed \uac70\uc810\ud56d\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub85c \ud658\ub3d9\ud574\uad8c\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\ud56d\ub9cc\uc73c\ub85c \uc790\ub9ac\ub9e4\uae40\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc790\uccb4\uc758 \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \ucc3d\ucd9c\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uae30\ubc18\uc870\uc131\uacfc \uc774\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc678 \uae30\uc5c5\uc720\uce58\uac00 \uad00\uac74\uc774\ub2e4. \ud2b9\ud788 \ud658\ub3d9\ud574\uad8c \ubb3c\ub958\uac70\uc810\uc758 \uc870\uc131\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \ud22c\uc790\uc720\uce58 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf9\ub3d9\ub7ec\uc2dc\uc544\uc758 \uc790\ub3d9\ucc28\uc218\ucd9c, \uc218\uc0b0\uc5c5, \ubaa9\uc7ac\uc5c5\uc744 \uc704\ud55c \uc720\ud1b5\ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uc758 \uc870\uc131\uc774 \uc694\uad6c\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uacbd\uc0c1\ubd81\ub3c4\uc758 \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c\uc774 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc77c\ubcf8\uc5d0 \uacf5\uae09\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d, \ub18d\uc0b0\ubb3c \ubb3c\ub958\uc13c\ud130\uac00 \uc870\uc131\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 \ub18d\uc218\uc0b0\ubb3c \uc218\uc785\uc5c5\uc790\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5c5\uc720\uce58 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc804\uac1c\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Pohang-Youngil port is the only sea route in Daegu-Gyeongbuk region.

To achieve such aim, Korea government is planning to create distriparks in major ports. Hardware supply of logistics facilities is as important as operational strategies of managing distriparks in the software perspective. The objective of this study is to provide target enterprises for enhancing the competitiveness of port distriparks in Korea. As the result of the analysis, electronics, automobile and machinery are the target industries for enhancing Korean distriparks. The results are summarized as follows. The electronics industry needs a distribution hub at a port to supply the parts and distribute products since the factories of the finished goods and the parts are scattered around the world for achieving low production costs whereas the automobile industry demonstrates a new technology of module production so the requirement of CKD centers at ports is more prevalent in the future. The machinery industry requires logistics facilities for JIT operation at production. Finally, several policies should be pressed forward to enhance the competitiveness of Korea\'s logistics industry through the distriparks."}]},"fpage":"101","lpage":"122","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.1.101","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.1.001","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001330539","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"03","volume":"25","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001330537","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"IMF \uc774\ud6c4 \uc911\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Small & Medium Size Company\'s Survival Analysis After IMF for Transportation Logistics"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Small & Medium Size Company\'s Survival Analysis After IMF for Transportation Logistics"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ud0dc\ud6c8(\uacbd\uc131\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc0c1\uc5f4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 IMF \uacbd\uc81c \uc704\uae30 \uc774\ud6c4 \uc911\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uccb4\ub4e4\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc774 \uc5b4\ub5a0\ud55c \uc9c0\ub97c \ud30c\uc545\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc0dd\uc874\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc989, \uc804\uccb4 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubb3c\ub958 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uacfc \uc704\ud5d8\ub960\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc600\uace0, \ud2b9\uc131\ubcc4\ub85c \ucc28\uc774\uc758 \uc720\uc758\uc131\uc744 \uac80\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc5b4\ub5a4 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubb3c\ub958 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc0dd\uc874 \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uace0\ub824\ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ud0d0\uc0c9\uc801 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \uc218\ud589\ud55c \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubb3c\ub958\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc18c\uc7ac\uc9c0, CEO\uc758 \uc131\ubcc4, \uc885\uc0ac\uae30\uac04 \ubc0f \uc2e0\uae30\uc220\uc0ac\uc5c5\uc790(\uae30\uc5c5\ud601\uc2e0\ud615 \uae30\uc5c5)\uc758 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc0dd\uc874\uc728\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc788\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098, \uc5c5\uc885\ubcc4, \uc885\uc5c5\uc6d0\uc758 \uaddc\ubaa8, \uae30\uc5c5 \ud615\ud0dc\ubcc4\ub85c\ub294 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d \ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \ucd94\ud6c4 \uc5f0\uad6c\uacfc\uc81c\ub85c\uc11c \ucf55\uc2a4\uc758 \ube44\ub840\uc704\ud5d8\ubaa8\ud615 \ub4f1\uc744 \ub4e4 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc911\uc18c\uaddc\ubaa8 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc0dd\uc874\ubd84\uc11d \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uadf8 \uae30\uc5ec\ub97c \ucc3e\uc744 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper analyzes the survival rate of small & medium size-transportation logistics company after IMF by using survival analysis.

Also, major industries of Korea have been changed from the traditional labor intensive industries as textile and lumber to high technology industries as ship, automobile and electronic devices. Especially, due to the international fragmentation of production, the textile industry of Korea has been lost its competitiveness against the new developed countries like China and Vietnam and the production throughputs of the industry also have been reduced. Nevertheless, according to the annual statistic report on maritime and fishery, shares of textile products out of the total container throughputs have been over 50% during the year 2002 to 2005. However, according to the national trade statistics, the textile trading volume was 12.7% and 8.9% of the total trading volumes in the year 2002 and 2006 respectively. This statistical difference derived from the categorizing method of items because one statistic report included plastics, rubbers, medical products, chemical products, metallic products, machineries, transportation equipments and agricultural and marine products as textile and its products while the other did not include. Therefore, in order to reduce the statistical difference, this paper proposed to strengthen marketing activities and to build up a penalty system."}]},"fpage":"41","lpage":"56","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2009.25.1.41","uci":"G704-000463.2009.25.1.008","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001330532","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2009","pub-mon":"03","volume":"25","issue":"1"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001330520","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud68c\uc0ac\uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uc790\uae08\uc870\ub2ec \uc131\uacfc\uc758 \uad6d\uc81c\ube44\uad50\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Review of Ship Financing through Ship Investment Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Review of Ship Financing through Ship Investment Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\uae30\ud658(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ud669\ub450\uac74(\ubd80\uc0b0\ubc1c\uc804\uc5f0\uad6c\uc6d0)","\uae40\uac15\ud601(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc138\uacc4 1\uc704\uc758 \uc870\uc120\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc744 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc73c\ub85c \uc138\uacc4\uc801 \ud574\uc6b4\uad6d\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uc7a5\ud55c \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uac00 \uc678\ud615\uc801 \uc131\uc7a5\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uae08\uc735\uce21\uba74\uc758 \ucde8\uc57d\uc131\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uad6d\uc81c\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc758 \uc57d\ud654\uac00 \ucd08\ub798\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \ud574\uacb0\ud558\uace0\uc790 2002\ub144 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud68c\uc0ac\uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \uc124\ub9bd\ud558\uc5ec \ucc28\uc785\uae08\uc735 \uc704\uc8fc\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735\uc744 \uc9c0\ubd84\ud22c\uc790\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc790\ubcf8\uc870\ub2ec \ubc29\uc2dd\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc120\ud55c \uc120\ubc15\uae08\uc735\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774 \ub300\ub450\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud68c\uc0ac\uc81c\ub3c4\ub294 \ub3c5\uc77c\uc758 K/G\ud380\ub4dc\uc640 \ub178\ub974\uc6e8\uc774\uc758 K/S\ud380\ub4dc\ub97c \ubca4\uce58\ub9c8\ud0b9\ud55c \uae08\uc735\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc774\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc99d\uad8c\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\uae08\uc870\ub2ec \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740 \uc138\uacc4 \ucd5c\ucd08\ub85c\uc11c \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ud380\ub4dc \ubc29\uc2dd\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ub41c \ud615\ud0dc\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud68c\uc0ac\uc81c\ub3c4\ub97c \ub3c5\uc77c\uacfc \ub178\ub974\uc6e8\uc774\uc758 K/G, K/S\uc640 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uc5ec \uc790\uae08\uc870\ub2ec\uc131\uacfc\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uc120\ubc15\ud22c\uc790\ud68c\uc0ac\uc81c\ub3c4\uac00 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \ub3c5\uc77c\uacfc \ub178\ub974\uc6e8\uc774\uc758 \uc120\ubc15\ud380\ub4dc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654\uc5d0 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud55c \uc138\uc81c\uc0c1 \ud61c\ud0dd\uc744 \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \ubd80\uc5ec\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uae30\uc6b8\uc5ec\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Korean shipbuilding industry is ranked in the first in the world with showing the market share of more than 35%.

Despite this reality, it is known to be too difficult to predict the movement of ocean freight rate. This paper attempts to show the causal relations between the MRI Time Charter Index of two to three months and that of over 6 months. That is because two MRI Time Charter Indexes tend to move very closely and seem to behave like one time series. First, I test for a unit root and then use the GPH procedure to test for long-run stability. The suitable models are chosen based on the significance and sign of error correction terms. The Granger causality test is used to determine the direction of causality. The Granger causality test, however, is very sensitive to the number of lags used in the analysis. This means that one has to be very careful in implementing the Granger causality test. This paper, hence, uses more lags than those which the Schwarz Information Criterion suggests. I show that MRI06(MRI Time Charter Index over 6 months) does not \u201cGranger-cause\u201d MRI23 (MRI Time Charter Index of 2-3 months), but MRI23 Granger-causes MRI06. This paper applies variance decompositions to the model, indicating that MRI03 is exogenous to MRI06. This study also shows that the effect-of-shocks line of MRI23\'s own is close to the actual observation of MRI23, while the effect-of-shocks line of MRI06\'s own is far from the actual observation of

The aim of this paper explores the alternatives for improving SIC in Korean shipping finance system through a comparison with German KG and Belgian Shipping NV. After a comparative review of three systems, SWOT analysis for Korean SIC has been conducted. Through SWOT analysis, it shows that Korean SIC has a main problem in the function of the internal policy system. It implies that Korean SIC should be amended to attract many various parties in both the long-term and global perspectives."}]},"fpage":"123","lpage":"153","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..59.123","uci":"G704-000463.2008..59.001","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001299800","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"12","volume":null,"issue":"59"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001299798","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"A Methodology for Risk Analysis on Ship Accidents at Port Area"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Methodology for Risk Analysis on Ship Accidents at Port Area"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ub3d9\uc9c4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uae40\uc0c1\uc5f4(\ubd80\uc0b0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uc6d0\uc720 \ubc0f \uc778\ud654\uc131 \ud654\ud559\ubb3c\uc9c8 \ub4f1\uacfc \uac19\uc740 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131 \ubb3c\uc9c8\uacfc \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc5d0 \uc774\ub974\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc885\ub958\uc758 \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ud558\uace0, \uc2b9\uac1d\uc744 \uc218\uc1a1\ud558\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ud65c\ub3d9\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\ub0b4\uc678\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ub300\ud615\uc0ac\uace0\uc758 \uce58\uba85\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \ub0b4\ud3ec\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud55c\ub2e4. \ud56d\ub9cc\ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub098\ub294 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc885\ub958\uc758 \uc0ac\uace0\ub294 \uc704\ud5d8\uc131 \ubb3c\uc9c8\ub4e4(\uc6d0\uc720,\uac00\uc2a4 \ub4f1)\uc758 \ubc29\ucd9c\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \uc2ec\uac01\ud55c \ud658\uacbd\uc624\uc5fc\uc744 \uc720\ubc1c \ud560 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\uace0, \uc0ac\uace0\ub85c \uc778\ud574 \ubb34\uace0\ud55c \uc0dd\uba85\uc744 \uc557\uc544\uac08 \uc218\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc131\uc774 \uc788\uc74c\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\ub978 \uc120\uc9c4\ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc \uc8fc\ubcc0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub0a0 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc7a0\uc7ac\uc801\uc778 \uc704\ud5d8\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c\uac00 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \ubd80\uc871\ud55c \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc1c\uc0dd \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0ac\uace0\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \uc704\ud5d8\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0, \uc9c0\ub09c 2002\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2007\ub144 \uc0ac\uc774\uc758 5\ub144\uac04 \uad6d\ub0b4 12\uac1c \ud56d\ub9cc\ub4e4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub09c \uc120\ubc15\uc0ac\uace0\uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubc1c\uc0dd \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc704\ud5d8\uc744 \uc0ac\ub9dd\uc790\uc218\ub97c \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \uc81c\uc2dc\uace0 \ud56d\ub9cc \uc704\ud5d8\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Ports are performing a great deal of activities including transport of passengers as well as different kinds of cargos ranging from standardized containers to dangerous and hazardous substances such as crude oil, flammable chemicals, etc. This means ports are not only the critical points connecting land and water but places encompassing fatal risk of huge accidents in and around the ports. Various types of accidents occurring in a port area can result in not only serious environmental problems due to the release of a hazardous material(oil, gas, etc) but death of many innocent lives. However, in Korea, detailed studies on potential risks in ports and surrounding areas have not much been researched compared to other countries.

In particular, this study examines the main factors on the growth of the water transport industry through the decomposition of aggregate output.\\nThe major findings of this study are as follows : First, water transport industry\'s contribution to the growth of aggregate output has been decreasing after the Year 2000, although the corresponding industry\'s ratio to the national economy was higher than other industries. Second, water transport industry\'s export demand, final goods, and technological change play key roles on the growth of aggregate output among the major factors. However, this industry\'s contribution to the Aggregate output\'s Growth has been decreasing after the year 2000.\\nIn conclusion, demand for export and final goods has an important role and put major impacts on the growth of the aggregate output. Thus, for the development and sustainable growth of the water transport industry, it is required to promote the logistics industry-related hinterland.

For example, even if the cargo was inherently dangerous, the damages caused by the failure of the owners to exercise due diligence to make the vessel seaworthy would be subject to the owners\' liability."}]},"fpage":"49","lpage":"75","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..59.49","uci":"G704-000463.2008..59.006","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001299793","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"12","volume":null,"issue":"59"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001299788","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uadfc\ud574 \uc815\uae30\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c - \uae30\uc5c5\ud30c\uc6cc\uc774\ub860\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uff0d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Growth Strategies of Short Sea Shipping Companies \uff0d by Applying the Firm Power Theory \uff0d"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Growth Strategies of Short Sea Shipping Companies \uff0d by Applying the Firm Power Theory \uff0d"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae38\uad11\uc218(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uace0\ubcd1\uc6b1(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uae40\uc740\uc218(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 2009\ub144 \ud55c\uc911 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud56d\ub85c, 2012\ub144 \ud55c\uc911 \uce74\ud398\ub9ac \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uac1c\ubc29\uc5d0 \ub300\uc751\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uadfc\ud574 \uc815\uae30\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc758 \uc131\uc7a5\uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45\ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ubc29\ubc95\ub860\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \uae30\uc5c5\ud30c\uc6cc \uc774\ub860\uc744 \ucc44\ud0dd\ud558\uc5ec, \uadfc\ud574 \uc815\uae30\uc120 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uae30\uc5c5 \uc131\uc7a5\uc804\ub7b5 \ubc0f \uc815\ucc45\ubc29\uc548\uc758 \ub3c4\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c \uacb0\uacfc, \ub3d9\ud0dc\uc801\u2024\uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \ud658\uacbd\uc73c\ub85c \uae09\ubcc0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uadfc\ud574 \uc815\uae30\uc120 \ud574\uc6b4\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0\uc11c \uc6b0\ub9ac \uadfc\ud574\uc120\uc0ac\ub294 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4(\ud56d\ub85c) \ud569\ub9ac\ud654 \ub4f1\uc758 \uae30\uc5c5\ud30c\uc6cc \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud558\uace0, \uc6b0\ub9ac \uc815\ubd80\ub294 \uc120\ubc15\uc6b4\ud56d\ud68c\uc0ac \uc81c\ub3c4 \ub3c4\uc785 \ubc0f \uc120\ubc15\uad00\ub9ac\uc5c5 \uc721\uc131 \ub4f1\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\ud30c\uc6cc \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \ucd94\uc9c4\ud560 \ud544\uc694\uac00 \uc788\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The objective of this study is to derive growth strategy and policy measures for short sea liner shipping companies considering the fact that the Korea-China liner shipping route will be liberalized as of 2009 (liberalization of container ships) and 2012 (liberalization of passenger/cargo ships).

YUAN dynasty levied 1,211,000 SEOK per year, and some 1 million SEOK was collected in southern part of China.\\nIt had been adapted the system to transport levied-rice by way of canal and inland waterway in the early of YUAN dynasty. But since it took long time and costed too much but it could transport rather little quantity, it could not satisfy the demand for the market. For overcoming these matters, YUAN dynasty took action to adapt new system to transport levied-rice by way of the ocean. There were scattered rocks, islets, and sands in northern passage. The vessel used for the northern passage was Chinese Junk, named Zhe-Yang ship. The characteristics of Zhe-Yang ship used for transporting levied-rice in YUAN dynasty is as follows; \\nFirstly, it has the flat-bow and -stern and -bottom and it could sail in regardless of direction of wind and current. Secondly, bulkhead and longitudinal beam were used for strengthening the longitudinal and the transverse strength of the ship. Thirdly, since Zhe-Yang ship has little resistance against current because it has rather big L/B ratio and little draft, it could be maneuvered with ease in comparison of steep bottom vessel."}]},"fpage":"149","lpage":"169","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..58.149","uci":"G704-000463.2008..58.006","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001282709","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"58"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001282707","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc18d\uc131\uacfc \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \u2015 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uacfc \uace0\uac1d\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc778\uc2dd\uaca9\ucc28 \u2015"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"On the Attributes and Competency of Container Terminal Services \u2015 Perceptional Inequality between Terminal Operators and Liner Companies in Busan \u2015"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"On the Attributes and Competency of Container Terminal Services \u2015 Perceptional Inequality between Terminal Operators and Liner Companies in Busan \u2015"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc624\uc6a9\uc2dd(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uad6c\uacbd\ubaa8(\ub3d9\uc758\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ub2e8\uc704\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc744 \uc8fc\uc694 \ubd84\uc11d\ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec, \ud56d\ub9cc\uad00\ub9ac\uc790\uac00 \uc544\ub2cc \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc6b4\uc601\uc0ac\uc758 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uac04 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc18d\uc131\uc744 \uc815\uc758\ud558\uace0, \uc774\uc5d0 \uadfc\uac70\ud558\uc5ec \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ubd80\uc0b0\ubd81\ud56d\uacfc \uc2e0\ud56d\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\\n\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud65c\ub3d9\ud558\ub294 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc6b4\uc601\uc790\uc640 \uae30\ud56d\uc120\uc0ac\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\ubb38\uc744 \uc218\uc9d1\ud558\uace0 AHP\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\ub97c \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 1\ucc28\uc801 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc18d\uc131 \uc911 \uc2e0\uc18d\uc131\uc774 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ud6c4 \uc800\ub834\uc131, \uc548\uc815\uc131, \ud3b8\uc758\uc131\uc758 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ubc30\uc5f4\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc740 \uc804\uccb4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0b0\uc2e0\ud56d, \ubd80\uc0b0\ubd81\ud56d, \uc0c1\ud574\ud56d, \uad11\uc591\ud56d\uc758 \uc21c\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\uba70, \uac01 \ud56d\ub9cc \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc740 \uc11c\ub85c \ub2e4\ub978 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc18d\uc131\ubcc4 \uac15\uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uac00\uc9c4 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub4dc\ub7ec\ub0ac\ub2e4.\\n\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uacfc \uace0\uac1d\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc778\uc2dd\uc740 \uc18d\uc131\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud06c\uac8c \ub2e4\ub974\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc73c\ub098 \uac01 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc758 \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uad00\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uc801\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uaca9\ucc28\uac00 \ud655\uc778\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper examines the major attributes and competency of inter-terminal competition, especially focusing on the specific viewpoints of individual container terminal.

To confirm the effectiveness of the index suggested in this paper, current level of knowledge management performance in a container terminal operator which is located at Busan port was measured."}]},"fpage":"89","lpage":"107","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..58.89","uci":"G704-000463.2008..58.002","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001282704","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"58"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001282703","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc9c0\uac01\ub41c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc774 \uace0\uac1d\ubc18\uc751\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c \u2015 \ubd80\uc0b0, \uccad\ub3c4, \ub300\ub828\ud56d\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c \u2015"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Effect of Perceived Port Hinterland Service Quality on Customer Behavior"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Effect of Perceived Port Hinterland Service Quality on Customer Behavior"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ubcd1\uc77c(\uc778\ucc9c\ud56d\ub9cc\uc5f0\uc218\uc6d0)","\uc720\ud64d\uc131(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ud604\uc6b0(\ub300\ud55c\ud1b5\uc6b4)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uace0 \uc774\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uace0\uac1d\uc758 \uc9c0\uac01\uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0\uc790 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \\n\uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uacb0\uc815\uc694\uc778\uc740 \u2018\uc720\ud615\uc131\u2019, \u2018\uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\u2019, \u2018\uacf5\uac10\uc131\u2019, \u2018\ud3b8\uc758\uc131\u2019, \u2018\uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc131\u2019\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ub428\uc744 \ud655\uc778\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc774\ub4e4 5\ucc28\uc6d0\uacfc \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871 \ubc0f \uace0\uac1d\ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubcc4 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc131, \ud3b8\uc758\uc131, \uace0\uac1d\ud589\ub3d9\uc774 \uc720\uc758\ud558\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc0c1\ud638\uc791\uc6a9\uc131, \ud3b8\uc758\uc131, \uace0\uac1d\ud589\ub3d9\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\ubc30\ud6c4\ub2e8\uc9c0\uac04 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ube44\uad50\uacb0\uacfc \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 \uccad\ub3c4\ud56d\uacfc \ub300\ub828\ud56d\uc5d0 \ube44\ud574 \ud3c9\uade0\uc774 \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\ub098 \ud1b5\uacc4\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \ub300\ub828\ud56d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c\ub9cc \uc720\uc758\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to survey the major factors of port hinterland service quality and to develop a tool for measuring service quality.

However, it is difficult to measure and account for all the reasons of ocean freight movement which are needed to set up an exact model. This paper employs two specific determinant variables for BDI modeling, namely China\'s import and dry cargo ship\'s space, which are generally thought to be significant on explaining the BDI. However the forecasts via the cause-effect econometric technique are not as accurate as the forecasts made via the ARIMA technique because a cause-effect econometric model cannot adjust itself for the post-sample. In some papers, it is shown that, from a forecasting viewpoint, the univariate time series approach may be preferable to the multivariate models. More recent papers show that the forecasting accuracy of stochastic ARIMA-type models are preferred to that of other models. The Box-Jenkins approach, hence, is used to fit a model to the BDI series and to explain the BDI movement. The BDI is expected to range approximately from 13,000 to 11,000 at the end of 2009, while the BDI is predicted to fall precipitously until the beginning of 2009 and continue to decline by the end of 2009 via the HP technique."}]},"fpage":"1","lpage":"18","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..58.1","uci":"G704-000463.2008..58.001","citation-count":"19","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001282692","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"57"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001252399","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"The Operation and Service Performance of Global Logistics Center in Tawan"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Operation and Service Performance of Global Logistics Center in Tawan"}]},"author-group":{"author":"CHIU Rong-her(Kainan University(Taiwan))"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"The development of \u201cglobal Logistics center\u201d plan has been promoted in Taiwan area since 2000.

Secondly, there were significant changes in revenue earned between large tramp shipping companies and small companies in 2004. However there was a significant difference in revenue earned for the small tramp shipping companies at 1% level between 1992 and 2004.\\nIn the estimation, as expected, the DWT has a positive effect on the shipping cost with 1% significance level at least.

construction of the other terminal of phase\u2160 will be completed within one or two years. \\nBut contrary to original expectations, the new terminal has failed to attract enough container cargo to utilize its facilities fully. In the short-term, the market potential for the new port is not expected to be so good. Considering various factors related to port development, the inducement of container cargo for the new port to handle might be more difficult due to the continuous construction activity at the new port. In other words, the future market for the port\u2019s business may be more risky and unpredictable regarding the consecutive supply of port cargo. \\nIn this thesis, the future proportion of container cargo handled by the New Port & the existing port were estimated through the logit model, the probabilistic choice model. The logit model can be established based on the utility function of each variable affecting customers\u2019 port preferences. \\nThis study is developed from other advanced studies by using SP (Stated Preference of customers) data to formulate utility function due to the lack of available RP (Real Preference of customers) data. \\nIn this thesis, freight rate, port-productivity, and the size of container cargo of the port\u2019s hinterland were selected as the most sensitive variables to the port preference of customers. The impacts on the port preference of customers by the value-change of effecting variables were calculated quantitatively. From this result, the uncertainty of the port business market, caused by the continuous lack of port cargo supply, is expected to decrease, and it is hoped that the new port & the existing north port will operate normally according to its facility."}]},"fpage":"49","lpage":"75","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..57.49","uci":"G704-000463.2008..57.001","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001256352","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"57"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001256351","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc694\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Analysis of Global Competition Factors at Busan Port"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Analysis of Global Competition Factors at Busan Port"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uadfc\uc12d(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uacfd\uaddc\uc11d(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 \uc911\uad6d\uc758 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \ub300\uaddc\ubaa8 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uacfc \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc778 \uc120\uc0ac\uc720\uce58 \uc804\ub7b5 \ub4f1\uc73c\ub85c \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc99d\uac00\uc728\uc774 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc640 \ub354\ubd88\uc5b4 \ub300\ub0b4\uc678\uc801\uc778 \ud658\uacbd\ub3c4 \uae09\ubcc0\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud658\uacbd \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc801\uc778 \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \ucc3d\ucd9c\uc744 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc874\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc694\uc778 \uc678\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ub300\uc801 \ubcc0\ud654\uc5d0 \ub9de\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc694\uc778\uc744 \ubc1c\uad74\ud558\uace0 \uac15\ud654\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub192\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uacfc \uad00\ub828\ud55c \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc758 \ucd5c\uadfc \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc120\ud589 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ub41c \uc694\uc778\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\ubcc4, \uc2dc\uae30\ubcc4 \ucc28\ubcc4\uc131\ub9cc\uc744 \uac15\uc870\ud560 \ubfd0 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc694\uc778\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ubc1c\uad74 \ubc0f \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uc740 \uac70\uc758 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\uc5d0 \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ucd5c\uadfc \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uadf8 \uc911\uc694\uc131\uc774 \ub354\ud574\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub294\uc9c0\ub97c \uc694\uc778\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc0b4\ud3b4\ubcf4\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc6b0\uc704 \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d\uacb0\uacfc \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c \uc694\uc778\uc740 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uacb0\uc815\ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc694\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ub418\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc774\ub97c \uae30\ubc18\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uae00\ub85c\ubc8c\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5\uc758 \ucd94\uc9c4\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc740 \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801 \uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uace0 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ud658\uc801\ud5c8\ube0c\uc758 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The growth of container throughputs of the Port of Busan has decreasing continuously by the massive green-field developments of Chinese ports and aggressive strategies of Japanese ports for attracting shipping liners. In addition to these competitive environments, circumstances in internal and external surrounding Busan port have also changed dramatically. Externally, container market has been changed to oligopoly market with the consequence of the introduction of global liner and operators. Internally, the growth rate of import and export volumes has decreasing by hollowing-out of manufacturing industry caused by overseas expansion and changing industrial structure from industry to service. Therefore, it is keenly necessary to develop and enhance new competitiveness factors in line with changing these internal and external environmental in order to attract more container throughputs consistently from competitors. However, the most of recent study related to port competitiveness had emphasized just differentiation of factors derived from previous research by regional coverage or period of time without development and assessment of new competitiveness factors. Thus, this study aims to investigate that whether port selection factors by customer side which becoming more important recently are conceived as important factors to improve competitiveness of container port or not through using factor analysis method and to suggest competitive advantage strategies of Busan port based on the results. The outcomes of analysis show that the global factors are regarded as important factors in determining port competitiveness. Therefore, Busan port has to enhance various globalization strategies for keeping competitive advantage and acting as transshipment hub port within the Northeast region."}]},"fpage":"25","lpage":"47","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..57.25","uci":"G704-000463.2008..57.004","citation-count":"8","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001256351","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"57"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001252395","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \ub300\ub9cc\uc758 \ube44\uad50\uc5f0\uad6c -\uc678\uc0dd\ud654\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec-"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Study on Economic Effects of the Water Transportation Sector in Korea and Taiwan Using Input-Output Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Study on Economic Effects of the Water Transportation Sector in Korea and Taiwan Using Input-Output Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc7a5\uc601\ud0dc(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ud0dc\uc6b0(\ub300\ub9cc \uce74\uc774\ub09c\ub300)","CHEN Tao(\ub300\ub9cc \uce74\uc774\ub09c\ub300)","\uc2e0\uc131\ud638(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","LIN Yu-chang(\ub300\ub9cc \uce74\uc774\ub09c\ub300)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \ub300\ub9cc\uc740 \ub300\uc678 \ubb34\uc5ed\uc758 \uc0c1\ud669\uacfc \uc9c0\uc815\ud559\uc801 \uc704\uce58, \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \uad6d\ubbfc\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \uc0c1\ud669 \ub4f1 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc720\uc0ac\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4\ud658\uacbd\uc744 \uac00\uc9c0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 1990\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2003\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \ud55c\uad6d\uacfc \ub300\ub9cc\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc774 \uac01\uad6d\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubb3c\uac00\ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uc804\ud6c4\ubc29 \uc5f0\uc1c4\ud6a8\uacfc \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uace0\ucc30\ud558\uace0, \ud574\uc6b4\ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \uc804\ud6c4\ubc29\uc5f0\uc1c4\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574 \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\uc758 \ud574\uc6b4\uc774 \ub098\uc544\uac00\uc57c \ud560 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc744 \ubaa8\uc0c9\ud574 \ubcf4\uc558\ub2e4. \uc0c1\uae30\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d \uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc744 \uc678\uc0dd\ud654\uc2dc\ucf1c \uc21c\uc218\ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc774 \ub450 \ub098\ub77c\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4\ub294 \uc720\uc0ac\ud558\uba70, \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uacfc \uc804\uccb4 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uad70\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud574 \ubcfc \ub54c, \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc774 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc774 \ub354\uc6b1 \ud06c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubc1d\ud600\uc84c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The international trade of Korea and Taiwan has been dependent upon international water transportation.

Therefore, the collaboration is a necessary and sufficient condition for the improvement of performance."}]},"fpage":"105","lpage":"132","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..56.105","uci":"G704-000463.2008..56.010","citation-count":"12","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001237905","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"56"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001237904","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud56d\uacfc \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc758 \ubb34\uc5ed\uad6c\uc870"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Mokpo Port and Regional Trade Structure"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Mokpo Port and Regional Trade Structure"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ubaa8\uc218\uc6d0(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud56d\uc740 \ub300\uc911\uad6d \uad50\uc5ed\uc758 \uae09\uc18d\ud55c \uc99d\uac00\uc5d0\ub3c4 \ubd88\uad6c\ud558\uace0 \uc911\uad6d\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uac70\uc758 \uacbd\ud5d8\ud558\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70 \uc77c\ubd80 \ud488\ubaa9\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc624\ud788\ub824 \ub300\uc911\uad6d \uad50\uc5ed\uc774 \uac10\uc18c\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc2e4\uc815\uc774\ub2e4. \ucd5c\uadfc \uac1c\uc7a5\ud55c \ubaa9\ud3ec\uc2e0\ud56d\uc740 \uae30\ub300\uc640 \ub2ec\ub9ac \uc774\ub807\ub2e4\ud560 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ubcf4\uc5ec\uc8fc\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc2e0\ud56d \uac1c\uc7a5 \uc774\ud6c4\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c\uacfc \uc774\uc804\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c\uc5d0 \ubcc4\ub2e4\ub978 \ucc28\uc774\uac00 \uc5c6\ub2e4. \ubaa9\ud3ec\ud56d\uc774 \uce68\uccb4\uc5d0 \ube60\uc9c0\ub294 \uac83\uc740 \ubc30\ud6c4\uc9c0\uc5ed\uc778 \uad11\uc8fc\uc640 \uc804\ub0a8 \uacbd\uc81c\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \ucd08\ub77c\ud55c\ub370\ub3c4 \uc6d0\uc778\uc774 \uc788\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub7ec\ub098 \uad11\uc8fc\uc758 \uc8fc\ub825 \uac00\uc804\uc81c\ud488\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c\uc774 \ubaa9\ud3ec\ud56d\uc744 \uc804\ud600 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uc804\ub0a8\uc758 \ud0c0\uc774\uc5b4\ub3c4 \ubaa9\ud3ec\ud56d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uc218\ucd9c\ub418\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8\uace0\ub294 TSI\uc640 RCA\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \uc218\ucd9c\ud488\ub4e4\uc758 \ub300\uc911\uad6d, \ub300\ubbf8\uad6d \ube44\uad50\uc6b0\uc704\uac00 \uc55e\uc73c\ub85c\ub3c4 \uacc4\uc18d \uc720\uc9c0\ub420 \uac83\uc784\uc744 \ubc1d\ud600, \uc774\ub4e4 \uc81c\ud488\uc744 \uc720\uc778\ud560 \ub300\uc548\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \ubcf4\uc778\ub2e4. \uadf8\ub9ac\uace0 \ubaa9\ud3ec\ud56d\uc758 \ubb34\uc5ed\uc774 1-2\uac1c \uad6d\uac00\uc640 1-2\uac1c \ud488\ubaa9\uc5d0 \ud3b8\uc911\ub418\uc5b4 \uc57d\uc810\uc744 \uadf9\ubcf5\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uacfc \ud488\ubaa9\uc758 \ub2e4\ubcc0\ud654\uac00 \ud544\uc694\ud558\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The main purpose of this study is to analyse the trade pattern of Gwangju and Jeonnam and identify the problems that Mokpo port has to solve. It is necessary to review the export and import patterns of Gwangju and Jeonnam which are the hinterlands of Mokpo port to detect the characteristics of the trade pattern of Mokpo port. This is because the export and import of Mokpo port depend on the economic condition of Gwangju and Jeonnam. Mokpo port is stagnating. Some look on these \u201cills\u201d either as childhood diseases or as residues of the past and, hence, either curable with time and patience or capable of being gradually mopped up. We, however, should realize that Gwangju and Jeonnam are also stagnating. Another important feature of Mokpo port is its high degree of dependence with very few commodities and countries. The passenger cars, for example, constitute most of its exports. Mokpo port has the problem of attracting a very small portion of its hinterland\'s exports. Furthermore Gwangju\'s main exports such as refrigerators, washing machines and air conditioners has not transported to Mokpo port at all. Mokpo port also has not attracted any of the tires produced in Jeonnam. This study shows that the so-called \'China Effect\' has not any effects on Mokpo port. This paper suggests that Mokpo port has to diversify its trading items as well as its trading countries. Mokpo port also must try to attract the more commodities produced in Gwangju and Jeonnam because two regions\' exports are expected to continue to have the comparative advantages."}]},"fpage":"85","lpage":"104","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..56.85","uci":"G704-000463.2008..56.004","citation-count":"11","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001237904","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"56"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001237903","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \uacbd\uc81c\uc790\uc720\uad6c\uc5ed \ud604\ud669\uacfc \uc6b4\uc601\uc804\ub7b5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Present Status and Operational Strategies for Korea\'s Free Economic Zone"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Present Status and Operational Strategies for Korea\'s Free Economic Zone"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc11c\ubb38\uc131(\uae08\uac15\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uacbd\uc81c\uc790\uc720\uad6c\uc5ed\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac00\uc7a5 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\ud558\uae30 \uc88b\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \ub9cc\ub4dc\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc120\uc9c4\uad6d \uc218\uc900\uc758 \uacbd\uc601, \uc0dd\ud65c \uc5ec\uac74\uc744 \uc870\uc131\ud0a4\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \uc678\uad6d\uc778 \ud22c\uc790, \uad50\uc721, \uae08\uc735 \ubc0f \ucd9c\uc785\uad6d\uc81c\ub3c4 \ub4f1 \uad6d\uac00 \ucc28\uc6d0\uc5d0\uc11c \uc9c0\uc6d0\uc774 \ud544\uc694\ud55c \ud589\uc815\uc218\uc694\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e0\uc18d\ud55c \ucc98\ub9ac\ub97c \uc9c0\uc6d0(One-Stop Service)\ud558\uae30\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec 3\uac1c \uacbd\uc81c\uc790\uc720\uad6c\uc5ed\uc744 \uc9c0\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911\uc774\uba70 \uc791\ub144 12\uc6d4 3\uac1c \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc744 \ucd94\uac00\ub85c \uc9c0\uc815 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc9c0\uc815\ub418\uc5b4 \uc6b4\uc601 \uc911\uc778 \uacbd\uc81c\uc790\uc720\uad6c\uc5ed\uc740 \uc5ec\ub7ec \uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810\uc744 \uc548\uace0 \uc788\uc73c\uba70, \uacbd\uc81c\uc790\uc720\uad6c\uc5ed\uc758 \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \ubc0f \uc6b4\uc601\uc0c1\uc758 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131 \uc81c\uace0\ub97c \uc704\ud574 \uaddc\uc81c\uc644\ud654 \ub4f1\uc758 \ubb38\uc81c\uc810 \uac1c\uc120\uacfc \ud22c\uc790 \uc99d\ub300, \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc640 \uc785\uc8fc \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc218\ucd9c \uc99d\ub300 \ub4f1 \uad6d\uc81c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uc99d\ub300 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub3c4\ub85d \ub4b7\ubc1b\uce68 \ub418\uc5b4\uc838\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The economic special zone managing in various forms comes into operation when the open-door policy and deregulation of the whole economy are really difficult.

Hire is the paid for the use of the vessel and is usually calculated on the basis of a fixed sum per ton of the vessel deadweight for a specific period of time. It is normally payable in advance at monthly or semi-monthly intervals. Where vessels are chartered for relatively long periods of time, there is constant exposure to the risks of currency devaluations, fluctuations in the market rete of hire, and the effects of inflation on the operating costs of the vessel defrayable by the shipowner. Vessels have accordingly been immediately withdrawn by their owners on a default in payment of the hire and then offered back to the identical charterers for the residue of the charter period at the current enhanced market rate. The courts have maintained a strict approach in the interpretation of such withdrawal clauses and have refused to exercise their discretion by extending towards the charterer any form of equitable relief against forfeiture. This problems can, however, be avoided by including in the charter an anti-technicality clause requiring the shipowner, on default in payment of hire, to give the charterer a specified period of notice before exercising his right to withdraw the vessel."}]},"fpage":"33","lpage":"60","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2008..56.33","uci":"G704-000463.2008..56.008","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001237902","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2008","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"56"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001237901","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud68c\ubcf5\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc774 \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871\uacfc \uad00\uacc4\uc9c8\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Effects of Service Recovery Justice on Customer Satisfaction and Relationship Quality in Shipping Market"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Effects of Service Recovery Justice on Customer Satisfaction and Relationship Quality in Shipping Market"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ucd5c\uc601\ub85c(\uac00\uc57c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc784\uad11\uc218(\ub18d\ub9bc\uc218\uc0b0\uc2dd\ud488\ubd80)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uc778 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uacfc \uadf8 \uc218\uc694\uc790\uc778 \ud654\uc8fc(\ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4)\uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub178\ub825\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uacfc \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871, \uad00\uacc4\uc9c8\uac04\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac80\uc815\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud55c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud68c\ubcf5\ub178\ub825\uc758 \uacf5\uc815\uc131\uc740 \uace0\uac1d\uc778 \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871\uc740 \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098 \ubab0\uc785\uc5d0\ub294 \uc9c1\uc811\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \uc54a\uace0 \uc2e0\ub8b0\ub97c \ub9e4\uac1c\ud558\uc5ec \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc2e4\ud328\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ud68c\ubcf5\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uace0\uac1d\ub4e4\uacfc\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc9c8\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uc2dc\ud0a4\ub294 \uace0\uac1d\uc720\uc9c0\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uad6c\uc0ac\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The objective of this research is to verify the structural relationship among 3 typical factors-service recovery justice, customer satisfaction and relationship quality, between shipping service provider and demander.

So it is important to keep a balance between demand for port service and port supply. Usually at the container terminal, port operators keep the berth occupancy rate around 40%. But the berth occupancy rate at exclusively used port is much higher than that of multi used port."}]},"fpage":"69","lpage":"88","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..55.69","uci":"G704-000463.2007..55.005","citation-count":"3","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001229253","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"12","volume":null,"issue":"55"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001229252","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\uacfc \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Valuation of Port Development using Real Options Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Valuation of Port Development using Real Options Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ud669\ub450\uac74(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uae30\ud658(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"2006\ub144\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uc2dc\ud589\ub41c \uc778\ucc9c\ub0a8\ud56d \uad6d\uc81c\uc5ec\uac1d\ubd80\ub450 \ubc29\ud30c\ud638\uc548 \uc0ac\uc5c5 \uc608\ube44\ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131 \uc870\uc0ac\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131 \ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \uc790\ub8cc\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\uc758 \uc801\uc6a9\uc744 \uc2dc\ub3c4\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc989 DCF\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\ud3c9\uac00\uc640 \uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc2e4\uc2dc\ud574 \ub450 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud558\uace0 \uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\uc758 \ud55c \ubc29\ubc95\uc778 \ucd95\uc18c\uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uc18d\uc5d0 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\ucd95\uc18c\uac00 \uc788\uc744\uc2dc \uadf8 \uac00\uce58\ub97c \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc \uae30\uc874\uc758 \ud604\uae08\ud750\ub984 \ud560\uc778\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\ud3c9\uac00\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \ub54c\uc758 \ud22c\uc790\uac00\uce58\uac00 \ub192\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\uc73c\ub098 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc740 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uadf8 \ud22c\uc790\uac00\uce58\uac00 \ub192\uc740 \uc774\uc720\ub294 \uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\uac00\uce58\ud3c9\uac00 \ubc29\ubc95\uc774 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131 \uc18d\uc5d0\uc11c \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c \uace0\uc720\uc758 \uc720\uc5f0\uc131\uc5d0 \ub300\ucc98\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\uc774 \ub0b4\ud3ec\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc73c\ub85c \ud480\uc774\ub41c\ub2e4.\ub610\ud55c \uc2e4\ubb3c\uc635\uc158\ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0\uc11c \ucd95\uc18c\uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud588\uc744 \ub54c\uc640 \ubcc0\uacbd\uc548\uc758 DCF \uac00\uce58\ud3c9\uac00\uc758 \ucc28\uc774\ub3c4 \ud06c\uac8c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ub2e4\uc2dc \ub9d0\ud574 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\uac1c\ubc1c\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \uc801\uc808\ud55c \uc635\uc158\uc778 \ucd95\uc18c, \ud655\uc7a5\uc635\uc158\uc744 \uc798 \uc801\uc6a9\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4\uba74, \ud604\uc7ac \ud56d\ub9cc\uc608\ube44\ud0c0\ub2f9\uc131\uc870\uc0ac\uc758 \uacbd\uc81c\uc131\ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 DCF\ubc95\uc758 \ubcf4\uc644\ub3c4\uad6c\ub85c \ucda9\ubd84\ud788 \uadf8 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud560 \uc218 \uc788\uc744 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud310\ub2e8\ub41c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This article is motivated by the questioning whether the existed economic feasibility valuation method of port investment could reflect the rapidly changing uncertainty of future port environment or not.\\nReviewing theoretical approaches on the valuation of new projects, the study was conducted by adopting the real option approach that would be considered as an important alternative of DCF model in the area of an economic feasibility evaluation of new projects.

Coastal shipping is an important and effective mode of transport minimising congestion and pollution, and reducing the number of accidents associated with freight movement. Korean government had introduced a few policy measures to promote the coastal shipping supporting coastal shipping companies but failed to do so because decision makers of freight movements i.e. shippers prefer to use road transport. Therefore it is important to develop a more effective policy measure to secure the carriage of goods by sea rather than by road. \\nThis paper will investigate Waterborne Freight Facilities Grant(WFFG) scheme available in U.K. as an Government assistance towards the capital cost of providing freight handling facilities to move goods by inland waterway or sea rather than road.

The paper also provided the detailed examination of Japan\u2019s liberalization of international air transport services and its impact on the bilateral trade in such services. The following major findings have been drawn. First, the Japanese government implemented gradual and phasein liberalization of international air transport services under the traditional bilateral framework and permitted new entrants as well as additional flights and routes in the bilateral market. On the other hand, the government did not promote marketoriented liberalization except in the bilateral relations with the US and Germany. Second, following the estimation results based upon gravity model, the size of economy, income level, and distance strongly affect air transport services trade between Japan and other countries. Third, the new liberal framework in the USJapan and GermanyJapan markets contributes to increasing both Japanese import and export of air transport services. Furthermore, Japan tends to export and import such services more in the relation with the countries whose airlines exercise beyond rights actively. Accordingly, one may conclude that marketoriented liberalization of international air transport services and liberalization of beyond rights will be beneficial to Japanese side as well as its counterparts."}]},"fpage":"177","lpage":"192","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..54.177","uci":"G704-000463.2007..54.006","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001080909","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"54"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001080908","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Minimum Risk Capital in Project Finance: Example of Harbor Infrastructure Development"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Minimum Risk Capital in Project Finance: Example of Harbor Infrastructure Development"}]},"author-group":{"author":["SHU Chen Kang(Feng Chia University)","LU Chan Yu(Keelung Harbour Bureau)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The ultimate success of a concession project depends on the joint investment partner chosen by the government. Although, for many projects, risk planning assessment is performed on the investment proposals submitted by investors, the importance of assessing whether the concession company possesses an adequate risk capital has been overlooked. The main objective of this study lies in introducing the market risk capital concept, which would serve as part of the criteria to be used by the government in assessing financial plans submitted by applicants. We adopted the Internal Models Approach (Value at Risk, VaR) developed by the Basle Committee (1994), together with Corporate Metrics developed by the J.P. Morgan Bank using the valueatrisk concept, to derive a minimum risk capital demand under specific financial planning.The thesis focuses on the Taipei Port\u2019s dock infrastructure development project to conduct a factual validation analysis. As revealed through the investor\u2019s investment plan and the government\u2019s stipulations, as opposed to the capital the initial project\u2019s investment applicant needs to raise being pegged at NT$3.756 billion, the net cash flow VaR derived from calculating the VaR puts the project\u2019s required minimum risk capital at NT$4.512 billion under the condition of a 50year buildandoperation period and at a 99% reliability level. The thesis\u2019 findings, by computing the market risk capital of various applicants and comparing the sums of capital the applicants propose to raise, serves to offer the reference point in the government\u2019s selection of the most favorable applicant. In practical implementation, the government may model a project\u2019s characteristics through a computer programming design and expeditiously obtain an applicant\u2019s required minimum capital upon obtaining the applicant\u2019s cash flow sequence, discount ratio and concession period."}]},"fpage":"145","lpage":"176","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..54.145","uci":"G704-000463.2007..54.008","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001080908","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"54"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001080907","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131\uc774 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\uc5f0\uad6c \u2015 \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uc744 \u4e2d\u5fc3\uc73c\ub85c \u2015"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on Impact of Service Orientation upon Business Performance in International Logistics Firm\u2015 Primarily on International Freight Forwarders \u2015"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on Impact of Service Orientation upon Business Performance in International Logistics Firm\u2015 Primarily on International Freight Forwarders \u2015"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc548\uccad\ud64d(\uc138\ud6a8 T L S)","\uc2e0\ud55c\uc6d0(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\uc601\ub85c(\uac00\uc57c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uad6d\uc81c\ubb3c\ub958\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uacf5\uc790\uc778 \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc640 \uadf8 \uc218\uc694\uc790\uc778 \ud654\uc8fc\uac04\uc758 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131\uacfc \uc885\uc5c5\uc6d0\ub9cc\uc871, \ud654\uc8fc\uac00 \uc9c0\uac01\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ud488\uc9c8, \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uac04\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uac80\uc815\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\ubaa9\uc801\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5f0\uad6c\uc640 \ud568\uaed8 \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uc2e4\uc99d\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ubcd1\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc8fc\uc120\uc5c5\uccb4\uc758 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc9c0\ud5a5\uc131\uc740 \uc885\uc5c5\uc6d0\ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \uc885\uc5c5\uc6d0\ub9cc\uc871\uc740 \ud654\uc8fc\uac00 \uc9c0\uac01\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ud488\uc9c8\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uba70, \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ud488\uc9c8\uacfc \uc885\uc5c5\uc6d0 \ub9cc\uc871\uc740 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uc131\uacfc\uc778 \uc7ac\ubb34\uc801 \uc131\uacfc\uc640 \uace0\uac1d\ub9cc\uc871\uc5d0 \uae0d\uc815\uc801\uc778 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ubd84\uc11d\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study aims to verify the structural relationship among service orientation, employees\' satisfaction and business performance primarily on the International Freight Forwarders.

In 2003 the government permitted ocean-going cargo transport companies to participate in coastal cargo shipping. Though coastal cargo shipping companies have appealed to the government for financial difficulty issued by severe competition, they do not have official and impartial statistics for the financial statement. The Korea Shipping Association as the organization of coastal cargo shipping companies has made and utilized the financial statement statistics since late 1990s, but the data could be evaluated to fail to reflect exact market conditions because the sample does not represent sufficiently the population.

That is because the Baltic freights tend to move very closely and seem to be one time series. First, I test for a unit root and then use the GPH procedure to test for long-run stability. The suitable models are chosen based on the significance and sign of error correction terms. The chosen models are estimated and the unbiased estimator hypothesis is tested. The unbiased estimator hypothesis might, however, be violated due to the existence of risk premium. This study, hence, models the conditional variance based on the GARCH specification, showing that the estimates provide some evidence of a nonzero constant risk premia for all freights. The Granger causality test is used to determine the direction of causality. Furthermore I employ the impulse response function to get an information regarding the responses of freight to the shocks in the other Baltic freight and show that the freight responds positively to the shock in the other freight and then decays relatively fast."}]},"fpage":"1","lpage":"21","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..54.1","uci":"G704-000463.2007..54.005","citation-count":"19","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001080693","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"53"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001065353","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Y.H.

Since maritime industry hollowing out from Kobe and the heavy concentration of business functions in Tokyo was evident from the late 1980s. The falling cargo volume from the hinterland, severe competition with ports in neighboring countries, and head office migration to Tokyo have all led to negative effects for the Kobe maritime cluster, such as a downsizing maritime company aggregation, an eroded image as a maritime city and reduced transactions between local companies.\\nTherefore, even though maritime clusters still exist in Kobe, cluster effects are being decreased by such things as a low (or zero) increase in local cargo volume and difficulties in contacting customers as result of opinion research into maritime specialists as follow. \\n1) Clustering effects of Kobe maritime cluster, such as business diversity, readiness of information acquisition, and resource utilization etc. are low level.\\n2) The low level of clustering effect is affected by the bad cluster structure, such as lack of leading companies, existence of entry and exit barriers.\\n3) Cluster performance of Kobe maritime cluster is influenced by low level of clustering effect. \\n4) Improving the clustering effect and forcing maritime cluster competitiveness requires various collective action programs. The first is to develop a knowledge based maritime cluster with a core of high level maritime knowledge.

And in relation to the second issue, the owners were entitled to rely on the article \u2163. rule 2(a) defence.\\nThe charterers appealed, contending that the arbitrators erred in law in relation to both issues."}]},"fpage":"83","lpage":"105","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..53.83","uci":"G704-000463.2007..53.010","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001065147","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"53"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001065146","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc778\uacf5\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9 \uc608\uce21 \uc801\uc6a9\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Application of the Port Cargo Throughput Forecast by the Neural Network Model"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Application of the Port Cargo Throughput Forecast by the Neural Network Model"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc804\ucc2c\uc601(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)","\uc1a1\uc8fc\ubbf8(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\uc218\uc0b0\uac1c\ubc1c\uc6d0)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc218\ucd9c\uc785\ud488\ubaa9 \uac01\uac01 10\uac1c\ub97c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc5ec, 4\uac1c\uc758 \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc720\ud615\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\ubd84\ud558\uc5ec \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uacfc \uc778\uacf5\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubaa8\ud615\uc758 \uc6b0\uc218\uc131\uc744 \uc801\ud569\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \uac01\uac01 \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubd84\uc11d \uacb0\uacfc \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc774 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uc18d\uc801\uc778 \uc0c1\uc2b9\uc744 \ud558\ub294 \u2018\uc0c1\uc2b9 \uc9c0\uc18d\ud615\u2019\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc801\ud569\uc131, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131, \uac15\uac74\uc131 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\uc774 \uc778\uacf5\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubaa8\ud615\ubcf4\ub2e4 \uc6b0\uc218\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \ubc18\uba74 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud558\ub098 \uc5f0\ub3c4\ubcc4\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\uc728\uc774 \ucc28\uce30 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \u2018\uc0c1\uc2b9 \ub454\ud654\ud615\u2019\uacfc \uc815\uccb4\ud558\uac70\ub098 \uc804\ubc18\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc99d\uac00\ub098 \uac10\uc18c\ub97c \ud558\uc9c0 \uc54a\ub294 \u2018\uc815\uccb4\ud615 \ub610\ub294 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\ud615\u2019\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 3\uac00\uc9c0 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc778\uacf5\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubaa8\ud615\uc774 \ub354 \ub098\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uad6c\uac04\ubcc4\ub85c \ubcc0\ub3d9\uc774 \ubd88\uaddc\uce59\uc801\uc774\ub098 \ub2e8\uacc4\ubcc4 \uc800\uc810\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\ub294 \u2018\ubd88\uaddc\uce59 \uc0c1\uc2b9\ud615\u2019\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0\uc5d0\ub294 \uc801\ud569\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud68c\uadc0\ubd84\uc11d\ubaa8\ud615\uc774, \uc2e0\ub8b0\uc131\uacfc \uac15\uac74\uc131 \uce21\uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\uacf5\uc2e0\uacbd\ub9dd\ubaa8\ud615\uc774 \ub354 \uc88b\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub098 \ud2b9\uc131\uce58\ubcc4\ub85c \ucc28\uc774\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In this paper, the neural network models are proposed and developed for forecasting port cargo throughput.

In the \'irregular growth type\' where change pattern is irregular but each section\'s bottom points of the irregular graph get higher as the pattern goes, the regression analysis showed strong in terms of fitness but the neural network model performed better in terms of reliability and robustness.

The central feature of the non-radial DEA model is that individual input reductions(output increments) are measured for solving the slacks problem in some inputs and outputs when using radial DEA model. The empirical main results of this paper are as follows: First, Gamman2004, Gamchon2004, Uam2003, Gamchon2003, and Uam2002 terminals have been appeared as the efficient ports in radial and non-radial DEA models. Second, non-radial DEA model has shown exactly the influential power of individual inputs for measuring the efficiency score of port and it improved the efficiency up to about 67% in the CCR(Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes) and BCC(Banker, Charnes and Cooper) models. Fourth, non-radial DEA model gives targets that concentrate on individual inputs/outputs without preserving their input/output mix. Therefore, for enhancing the efficiency score, the port authority and planner should introduce the non-radial model for measuring the efficiency score of each port or terminal in Korea."}]},"fpage":"17","lpage":"41","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..53.17","uci":"G704-000463.2007..53.009","citation-count":"12","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001065144","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"53"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001065143","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uad6d \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis of Competitiveness for Korean Shipping Companies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis of Competitiveness for Korean Shipping Companies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc2e0\uc0c1\ud5cc(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\uba85\ud5cc(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uad6d\ub0b4 \ud574\uc6b4\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\ub0b4 28\uac1c \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc5c5\uac04 \uc885\ud569\uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud55c\ub2e4. \uba3c\uc800 \uc0b0\ucd9c\ub7c9 \uac10\uc18c \uc5c6\uc774 \ubaa8\ub4e0 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc694\uc18c\ub97c \ube44\ub840\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\ub300\ud55c \uc904\uc77c \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc815\ub3c4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ud22c\uc785\ubb3c\uac70\ub9ac\ud568\uc218\ub97c \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uc5ec \uae30\uc220\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uacfc \uc790\ubcf8\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uac00\uaca9\uc744 \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud55c \ub2e4\uc74c \uc774 \ub450 \uc9c0\ud45c\ub97c \uac00\uc911 \ud3c9\uade0\ud558\uc5ec \uadf8 \ud06c\uae30\ub97c \ube44\uad50\ud55c\ub2e4. \uae30\uc220\ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc740 \ud604 \uc218\uc900\uc758 \ub2e8\uae30 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\ub294 \uc9c0\ud45c\uc774\uace0 \uc790\ubcf8\uc758 \uc554\ubb35\uac00\uaca9\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc694\uc18c \uac04 \ub300\uccb4\uac00\ub2a5\uc131, \uae30\uc220\uc218\uc900 \ub4f1 \uae30\uc5c5 \ub0b4\ubd80\uc758 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uacf5\uc815 \ud2b9\uc131\uae4c\uc9c0 \ubc18\uc601\ub41c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \uc131\uc7a5\uc758 \uc7a0\uc7ac\ub825 \ud310\ub2e8\uae30\uc900\uc774 \ub420 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc790\ubcf8 \uc554\ubb35\uac00\uaca9\uc758 \uac00\uc911\uce58\ub97c 50%\ubd80\ud130 10%\uc529 90%\uae4c\uc9c0 \ub298\ub824 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \ube44\uad50\ud55c \uacb0\uacfc, \uc0c1\ud558\uc704 5\uac1c \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc21c\uc704\uc5d0\ub294 \ud070 \ub4f1\ub77d\uc740 \uc5c6\uc5c8\uc73c\ub098 \uc911\uc704\uad8c \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \ubd80\uce68\uc774 \uad50\ucc28\ud558\ub294 \ubaa8\uc2b5\uc744 \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"In this paper, as providing a methodology that enables one to measure the competitiveness of Korean shipping industry, we analyze comprehensive competitiveness with data for 28 firms. First, using an input distance function, which measures the maximum amount by which all inputs can be proportionally reduced while maintaining the level of output, we derive the degree of technical efficiency and shadow price of capital. The technical efficiency captures the short-run competitiveness. The shadow capital price may be used in evaluating growth potential in that it reflects firm-specific characteristics of production process such as substitution possibilities of input factors and technical change. Then the weighted average values of these two indexes are calculated and compared across firms."}]},"fpage":"1","lpage":"15","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":"http://dx.doi.org/10.37059/tjosal.2007..53.1","uci":"G704-000463.2007..53.001","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001065143","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2007","pub-mon":"03","volume":"52","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001046942","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud55c\uff1f\uc911

The analysis employs the binary logit model with data collected from 247 Korean shippers for export and import in the Capital Region. The survey reveals basic characteristics and preferences related to the choice of shipping modes. The results indicate that, in order to choose the transport mode, shippers consider several other factors in addition to the ocean freight rate, and they can change their shipping modes under certain conditions. However, the empirical analysis identifies that ocean freight rate per mile, the difference of transit time between car ferries and container liners, the volume of shipping and the characteristics of container cargo are statistically significant. On the other hand, the difference of service level between car ferries and container liners is statistically insignificant."}]},"fpage":"69","lpage":"89","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2006.51..001","citation-count":"17","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001042650","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2006","pub-mon":"12","volume":"51","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001042648","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud55c \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\ubcc4 \uad6d\ubbfc\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\uc758 \uc0c1\ud638\ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Comparative Study on Economic Effects of Transport Modes on the Korean Economy Using Input-Output Analysis"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Comparative Study on Economic Effects of Transport Modes on the Korean Economy Using Input-Output Analysis"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc774\ud0dc\uc6b0(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc7a5\uc601\ud0dc(\uc778\ud558\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc2e0\uc131\ud638(\ud3c9\ud0dd\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ubd84\uc11d\uc5d0 \uc758\ud558\uc5ec 1990\ub144\ubd80\ud130 2000\ub144\uae4c\uc9c0\uc758 \uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\ubcc4\uc758 \uad6d\ubbfc\uacbd\uc81c\uc801 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \uc0c1\ud638 \ube44\uad50\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uacc4\uc218 \uba74\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc5f0\uc548 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ub959\uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc774 1990\ub144\uacfc 1995\ub144\uc5d0\ub3c4 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38 \uc911 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc544 \ub192\uc558\uc73c\ub098 2000\ub144\ub3c4\uc5d0\ub294 \ucca0\ub3c4\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \uc601\ud5a5\ub825\uacc4\uc218\uac00 \uc5f0\uc548 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ub959\uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \uadf8\uac83\ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub192\uc558\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uc548 \ubc0f \ub0b4\ub959\uc218\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc758 \uac10\uc751\ub3c4\uacc4\uc218\ub294 \uac19\uc740 \uae30\uac04\uc5d0 \uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38 \uc911\uc5d0\uc11c \uac00\uc7a5 \ub0ae\uc558\uace0, \ub3c4\ub85c\ud654\ubb3c\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc740 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uac10\uc751\ub3c4\uacc4\uc218\ub97c \ubcf4\uc600\ub2e4. \ucca0\ub3c4\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uacfc \ud56d\uacf5\uc6b4\uc1a1\ubd80\ubb38\uc740 \uac01\uac01 \uac00\uc7a5 \ub192\uc740 \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc720\ubc1c\uacc4\uc218\uc640 \uc218\uc785\uc720\ubc1c\uacc4\uc218\ub97c \uae30\ub85d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This paper intends to conduct a comparative study on the economic effects upon the Korean economy by transport mode, ie road, rail, air, and coastal and inland water transportation between 1990 and 2000, using input-output analysis. The economic effects consist of backward and forward linkage effects, production inducing and import-inducing effects. The data employed for this study come from the Bank of Korea database for Input-Output structure of the Korean economy. The major findings in this study are, among others: (1) the power of dispersion(=backward linkage effect) of coastal and inland water transportation sector is the highest among the four transport sectors, while road cargo transport mode shows the highest degree of sensitivity (=forward linkage effect); (2) rail cargo transport presents the highest production inducing effects; and (3) air

Three major research findings have been drawn. First, in 1986, the Japanese Ministry of Transport abolished market segregation among three major carriers and implemented gradual deregulation measures. The measures ranged from the introduction of double and triple track policy of 1986 to the abolishment of price regulation and demand-supply control regulation in 2000. Market concentration ratio decreased and the number of routes where multiple carriers would serve increased considerably. Second, most conjectural variations at the industry level after 1986 are between -0.1 and +0.1, implying that the Japanese domestic airline market is characterized by Cournot competition or competition which is slightly tougher than Cournot competition. Finally, according to conjectural variations, competition has been intensified following the introduction of free market system into the Japanese domestic airline market in 2000."}]},"fpage":"243","lpage":"258","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..47.006","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120985","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"12","volume":null,"issue":"47"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000980903","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc911\uad6d\ubc1c Sea & Air \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9\uc2e4\ud0dc \ubc0f \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis on the Use and Evaluation of Sea & Air Multimodal Transport Service"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis on the Use and Evaluation of Sea & Air Multimodal Transport Service"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\uad11\uc11d(\uc778\ucc9c\uc2dc\uccad)","\uc774\ucda9\ud6a8(\ud55c\uad6d\uc218\uc790\uc6d0\uacf5\uc0ac)","\uc804\uc77c\uc218(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\ucc9c\uacf5\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c Sea & Air \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uc5d0 \uc885\uc0ac\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \ud3ec\uc6cc\ub354\ub4e4\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc911\uad6d \ubc1c Sea & Air \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\uc758 \uc774\uc6a9\uc2e4\ud0dc\uc640 \ub9cc\uc871\ub3c4\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc870\uc0ac\ub97c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4.

This paper conducted against forwarders who are engaged in Sea & Air transport service concerning the use and evaluation of Sea & Air multimodal transport service. The respondents of this survey were divided into two separate groups, based on the subjects\u2019 work experiences and occupational position within their firms.The result of this analysis showed, overall, no significant differences between the two groups in the satisfaction level with an exception of airline frequency and cargo space. However, the two groups showed visible differences in evaluating the importance of airline frequency, cargo space, forwarder\u2019s service quality, and transshipment handling capacity. In addition, the analysis showed that the most important factors in vitalizing the Sea & Air multimodal transport in Incheon Airport are: rapid development of logistics parks around seaports and airport, and simplification of procedures for bonded inland transport between seaports and airport, respectively."}]},"fpage":"223","lpage":"242","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..47.010","citation-count":"7","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000980903","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"12","volume":null,"issue":"47"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120928","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958\ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5: \ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc744 \uc911\uc2ec\uc73c\ub85c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Effect of Environmental Factor on Logistics Integration and Logistical Cost : Approach to Korean Shipping Firms"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Effect of Environmental Factor on Logistics Integration and Logistical Cost : Approach to Korean Shipping Firms"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc724\uad11\uc6b4(\ubd80\uacbd\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ubc30\ud76c\uc131(\uacbd\uc131\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud574\uc6b4\uae30\uc5c5\uc740 \ud604\uc7ac \ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654\uc640 \uce58\uc5f4\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\ud658\uacbd\uc5d0\uc11c \uc0dd\uc874\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ub0b4\ubd80 \ud6a8\uc728\uc131\uc744 \ub2ec\uc131\ud558\uace0, \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c(LIS)\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0, \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \ubb3c\ub958\ud1b5\ud569\uc218\uc900\uc744 \ub192\uc784\uc73c\ub85c\uc368 \uc2dc\uc7a5\uc5d0\uc11c \uacbd\uc7c1\uc6b0\uc704\ub97c \ub2ec\uc131\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ud658\uacbd\uc801 \uc694\uc778\uc774 \ubb3c\ub958\ud1b5\ud569\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\ube44\uc6a9\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774 \ubaa9\uc801\uc774\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uacb0\uacfc \uccab\uc9f8, \ud658\uacbd\uc758 \ubd88\ud655\uc2e4\uc131\uacfc \ubb3c\ub958\uc815\ubcf4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\ud1b5\ud569\uc5d0 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce5c\ub2e4. \ub458\uc9f8, \ubb3c\ub958\ud1b5\ud569\uc740 \ubb3c\ub958\ube44 \uc808\uac10\uc744 \uac00\ub2a5\ud558\uac8c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Logistics integration requires both internal functional integration and external integration.

The measure showed that USA, Japan, and China are important countries for Korea to cooperate for the international logistics and its standardization. However, for these countries, Korea is not important country in terms of the international logistics because of the absorption rates of these countries to Korea are relatively very low. In addition, the relative extent to its importance of international standardization in Korea is larger than that in Japan.

Therefore, this study will show an empirical analysis output more thoroughly in the making a diagnosis of issues or problems to female workers\' employment state and gender discrimination and thus help shipping firms to manage female workers efficiently and enhance competitive power of human resources in that industry.For this empirical study, we firstly measured gender discrimination, job satisfaction and OCB with Likert 7 points scale. Specially, OCB is measured as five dimensions which are altruism, conscientiousness, sportsmanship, courtesy and civic virtue. And, we verified two hypotheses established from this study\'s model through SEM analysis. Now to conclude, we are able to examine, by and large, the negative effect of gender discrimination on job satisfaction and the positive effect of female workers\' job satisfaction on OCB.This finding is in line with previous results and make a significant contribution to an approach for the utilization of female workers and dissolution of gender discrimination in shipping industry where it has been considered that their employment is not desirable traditionally.

The resource-focused research model is developed identifying transport resource, international expansion, international strategies variables and performance outcomes. Five specific research hypotheses are derived, and the natures of the relationships underlying the constructs are tested by various statistical approaches. Resources were found to be real levers of international market participation of transport companies. It was also assured that a resource-focused theory can best explain the international expansion of transport companies.

This paper attempts to rectify that situation through the analysis of the opinions of container yard (CY) operators, the decision-makers who determine the extent rail cargo transport is used in Korea. This research is especially needed as Korea Railroad (KR) recently has been semi-privatized and will have to take a more consumer-oriented approach to meet the business needs of its primary customers. From the survey responses received, the research team was able to divide the CY operators into two groups based on such variables as rail dependency, volume of rail traffic, and location (Busan versus Euiwang in the Seoul area) to demonstrate statistically significant differences of opinion about what improvements those operators seek. The major findings of this research indicated that targeted improvements to rail transport could lead to increasing rail cargo traffic, which would translate into a host of economic and social benefits for Korea."}]},"fpage":"161","lpage":"180","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..46.004","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120805","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"46"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000971251","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc601\uad6d \ud574\uc0ac\uc911\uc7ac\uc81c\ub3c4\uc758 \uc5ed\uc0ac\uc801 \ubc1c\uc804\uacfc \uadf8 \uc2dc\uc0ac\uc810"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Historical Development of London Maritime Arbitration and Suggestion for Improvement of the Korean Maritime Arbitration System"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Historical Development of London Maritime Arbitration and Suggestion for Improvement of the Korean Maritime Arbitration System"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc131\uc900(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":{"@lang":"original"}},"fpage":"131","lpage":"159","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..46.006","citation-count":"17","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000971251","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"46"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000971250","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"AHP\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub099\ub3c4\ubcf4\uc870\ud56d\ub85c \uc190\uc2e4\ubcf4\uc0c1\uae08 \uc9c0\uae09\ubc29\uc2dd\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on Indemnity Management System of Remote Island Route Using AHP"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on Indemnity Management System of Remote Island Route Using AHP"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ub178\ucc3d\uade0(\ubaa9\ud3ec\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc740 \ub099\ub3c4\ubcf4\uc870\ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\ubcf4\uc0c1\uae08 \uc6b4\uc601 \ud604\ud669 \ud30c\uc545\uacfc AHP \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc190\uc2e4\ubcf4\uc0c1\uae08 \uc9c0\uae09\ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc120\uc815\ud558\ub294 \ub370 \uadf8 \uc758\ubbf8\uac00 \uc788\ub2e4.\uc774 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub099\ub3c4\ubcf4\uc870\ud56d\ub85c\uc5d0 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc6d0\ub9ac\ub97c \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uace0, \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc790\uc758 \uacbd\uc601\uac1c\uc120 \ub178\ub825\uc744 \uc720\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec \uad6d\uac00\uc608\uc0b0\uc744 \uc808\uac10\ud558\uace0, \ub3c4\uc11c\ubbfc\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \ud5a5\uc0c1\uacfc \ud56d\ub85c\uc758 \uc548\uc815\uc131\uacfc \ud589\uc815\ud6a8\uc728\uc744 \ub3c4\ubaa8\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 \ucd5c\uc801\uc758 \uc190\uc2e4\ubcf4\uc0c1\uae08 \uc9c0\uae09 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc744 \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc190\uc2e4\ubcf4\uc0c1\uae08 \ubc29\uc2dd\uc740, \uc6b0\uc120 \ub2e8\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c\ub294 \uc0ac\uc5c5\uc790\uac00 \uc790\uc728\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc9c0\uae09\ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc120\ud0dd\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ud604 \uccb4\uc81c\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\ud558\uace0, \uc911\xb7\uc7a5\uae30\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc601\ub9ac\uae30\uad00(\uacf5\ub2e8, \ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\uc870\ud569) \ubc0f \ud1b5\ud569\uc120\uc0ac\ub85c \uc6b4\uc601\uc8fc\uccb4\uac00 \ubcc0\uacbd\ub420 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc0ac\uc804\uc815\uc561\uc81c\ub97c \ud655\ub300 \uc2dc\ud589\ud558\ub294 \uac8c \ubc14\ub78c\uc9c1\ud558\ub9ac\ub77c \ubcf8\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The purpose of this study is to examine the current indemnity system of remote island route and to propose an indemnity management system using AHP Schemes. \\nThis study examines indemnity system of remote island route which implements competition principle, support enhanced management system to reduce the national budget, and promote customer service to the island residents, safety of the route, and the administrative efficiency.

Since the 1990s, air passenger and cargo traffic volumes in this region has increased dramatically, and potential demand is enormous. In response to such trends, many Asian countries have opened new airports or expanded existing facilities in the hopes of laying claim to the main international hub airport in the region. The government of Korea is driving a national strategy for developing a regional logistics hub in the Northeast Asia and air cargo plays a great role in international logistics. But little attention has been paid to the competitiveness of the air cargo industry even after the opening of Incheon International airport The purpose of this study is to analyse the export behaviors of airport based on the structural model. The GPH cointegration test supports that the structural model is stationary. The coefficient on the error-correction term is very low, meaning that exports of airport can not adjust the short-run disequilibrium quickly and are vulnerable to untoward events. This paper also applies impulse-response functions to the structural model. The results indicate that while exports respond positively to the shocks in industrial activity and then decay very slowly, responses to the exchange rate shocks are very small compared to industrial production shocks."}]},"fpage":"95","lpage":"111","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..46.010","citation-count":"5","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120804","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"09","volume":null,"issue":"46"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120803","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc758 \ubd80\uc9c0\ubb38\uc5b8\uc774 \uc1a1\ud558\uc778, \uc218\ud558\uc778, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \uc601\ud5a5\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"A Study on the Effects of the Unknown Wording in the Bill of Lading upon Shipper, Consignee, Carrier"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A Study on the Effects of the Unknown Wording in the Bill of Lading upon Shipper, Consignee, Carrier"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc774\uc81c\ud604(\ud55c\ub0a8\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"FCL\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uacbd\uc6b0 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc740 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \ubd80\uc9c0\ubb38\uc5b8\uc744 \uae30\uc7ac\ud558\uc5ec \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc744 \ubc1c\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ubbf8\uad6d, \uc601\uad6d, \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \ub300\ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc5d0 \uae30\uc7ac\ub41c \ubd80\uc9c0\ubb38\uc5b8\uc758 \ud6a8\ub825\uc744 \uc778\uc815\ud558\uc600\uace0 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubc95\uc6d0\uc758 \uc778\uc815\uc740 \uc1a1\ud558\uc778, \uc218\ud558\uc778, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778 \uac04\uc758 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \uc758\ubb34\uc640 \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \ubc1c\uc0dd\uc2dc\ucf30\ub2e4. \uc1a1\ud558\uc778\uc740 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc774 \uc81c\uacf5\ud55c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ub97c \ubc18\ub4dc\uc2dc \ud655\uc778\ud574\uc57c\ud558\uace0, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc5d0 \ud654\ubb3c\uc744 \uc801\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ub97c \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \uc778\ub3c4\ud558\uc5ec\uc57c\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc5d0 \ub9de\uac8c \uc6b4\uc1a1\ud574\uc57c \ub418\ub294 \uc81c\ubc18 \uc870\uac74\uc744 \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc5d0\uac8c \ud1b5\uc9c0\ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc740 \ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \ud558\uc790\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574\uc11c \uc804\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ucc45\uc784\uc744 \uc838\uc57c\ud558\uace0 \ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\uacfc\uc815\uc5d0\uc11c \ud574\uc0c1\uc704\ud5d8\uc73c\ub85c \uc190\ud574\uac00 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\uba74 \uadf8 \uc190\ud574\ub97c \ubcf4\ud5d8\ud68c\uc0ac\uc5d0 \uccad\uad6c\ud560 \uc218 \uc5c6\ub294 \uac00\ub2a5\uc131\ub3c4 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc54c\uc544\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc6b4\uc1a1\uc778\uc740 \ubd80\uc9c0\ubb38\uc5b8\uc758 \ud6a8\ub825\uc774 \ub9e4\uc6b0 \uc81c\ud55c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc815\ub41c\ub2e4\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uc798 \uc54c\uc544\uc57c\ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"When bill of lading is issued for FCL cargo packed and sealed by shipper, carriers inevitably insert expressions such as \u201cShipper\'s Load and Count\\" or \u201cSaid to Contain.\\" The legal effect of bill of lading description is known as Prima facie evidence.

This study focuses on two distinct routes: one on trunk routes covering trans-Pacific trade and trans-European trade between Far-east Asia, and North America and Europe, respectively; the other on short sea routes in intra-Asia trade. The major methodology of this research is to survey the major liners. The survey form is to be distributed to the lines operating both on mainhaul services and on intra-Asia services. Applied methods include factor analysis, cluster analysis and t-test to check how questions and sampled companies reacted to the given survey form.

The major methodology of this research is to survey the major liners. The survey form is to be distributed to the lines operating both on mainhaul services and on intra-Asia services. Applied methods include factor analysis, cluster analysis and t-test to check how questions and sampled companies reacted to the given survey form.

A letter of indemnity shall not be used for the camouflage of a claused or dirty bill of lading for the goods under damaged or unsound conditions. Such a document would constitute the act of deception. In such instances, the third parties as well as the concerned parties could be damaged: The issuance of a clean bill of lading for dirty or damaged goods may expose the shipowner to potentially heavy claims from the bonafide third parties who have relied on the clean bill of lading.When guarantees or agreements, such as letters of indemnity, are accepted by the carrier in consideration for a clean bill of lading, it is tantamount to fraud, and therefore its legal effect or enforceability has been declined by the civil and common law courts. Even under special circumstances without any element of intended deceit,-e.g., in the case of a bonafide dispute as to the apparent good order and condition-the use of the letter of indemnity at shipment leaves the door open for some shippers to conceal their negligence, leading to the potential detriment of commercial confidence generally.

The firms\' logistics standardization level is surveyed in relation to transportation, inventory, loading & unloading, packaging and information system, respectively. The ratio of standard pallets use is defined as the level of the firm\'s standardization in logistics management. We study how the firm\'s logistics cost is affected as the logistics standardization level goes up and the ratio of standard pallet use increases. The analyse of the logistics standardization level in the firm is proposed based on the survey data. The result finds that the firm may reduce its logistics cost by 11% according to its logistics standardization level based on pallet standardization. Increasing the logistics standardization by raising the level of standard pallets use, the efficiency of vehicle freight is increased, the damaged rate of goods and the loading & unloading time are decreased, but the inventory space utilization in the warehouse is decreased. This study also finds that the logistics standardization can reduce 13% of the total fright transportation costs by shifting the modal share."}]},"fpage":"121","lpage":"144","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..45.011","citation-count":"21","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120736","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"45"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120735","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\uc640 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ub3d9\ud5a5\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c \ud65c\uc131\ud654 \uc804\ub7b5"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Active Strategy of Local Economy for Port Logistics and Port Policy"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Active Strategy of Local Economy for Port Logistics and Port Policy"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uae30\ubc94(\uacc4\uba85\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc624\ub298\ub0a0 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uc804\ud1b5\uc801\uc778 \uac1c\ub150\uc5d0\uc11c \ubc97\uc5b4\ub098 \ud65c\ub3d9\uc601\uc5ed\uc744 \ub113\ud788\uace0 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc758 \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ubcf4\ub2e4 \ub2a5\ub3d9\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucc3d\uc870\uc790\uc801 \uc785\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc11c\uc788\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uac70\ub300\uc131\uc7a5, \uae30\uc220\uc0c1\uc758 \ubcc0\ud654, \ud56d\ub9cc\uad00\ub9ac, \ud56d\ub9cc\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub9c8\ucf00\ud305\uc804\ub7b5, \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\uc5d0 \uad00\ud574 \uc911\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uc5b4 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc774\uace0 \ucd1d\uccb4\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc138\uc6b0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\uae30\uc9c0\ub85c\uc11c, \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c \ud65c\uc131\ud654\uc758 \uc911\uc2ec\uc9c0\ub85c\uc11c \ucee4\ub2e4\ub780 \uc601\ud5a5\uc744 \ubbf8\uce58\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ucc98\ub7fc \ud56d\ub9cc\uc740 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c\uc131\uc7a5\uc5d0 \uc788\uc5b4\uc11c \uc911\ucd94\uc801\uc778 \uc5ed\ud560\uc744 \ud558\uac8c \ub41c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub098\ub77c\uc758 \uc8fc\uc694 \ud56d\ub9cc\uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc815\ucc45\uc758 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c \uac01\uc885 \ubb38\uc81c\ub97c \uc804\uccb4\uc801\xb7\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uacb0\ud574 \ub098\uac08 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc804\ub7b5\ub4e4\uc744 \ubb38\ud5cc\uc5f0\uad6c\ub97c \ud1b5\ud574\uc11c \uc7ac\ubd84\uc11d\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"At the present time, Ports have to extend their domain by deviating from traditional concepts and becoming more active.

Integer goal programming is employed as the methodology and genetic algorithm is applied in solving the problem due to computational efficiency and complexity of a problem. In our model, we compare the total costs and times among various types of multimodal transportation networks from overseas origins to final destinations in the capital region or vice versa.

Further, due to the rapid changes in world trade and shipping environment, today\'s ports face ever-increasing competition, from adjacent competing ports. Thus, in order to maintain the competitiveness of a port, each country spurs its port development, and at the same time, improves port-logistics industries to meet more diversified demands through high value-added services, such as e-business. \\nIn the mean time, to promote e-business in port-logistics area, many policies have been suggested since then. However, most of previous studies have focused on building the e-business sites/or e-marketplace and contents of e-business service without through identification of their industrial structures. Further, there has been no research based on the related theories. As a result, despite research and projects for port-logistics related e-business, prominent achievements have not been presented, and moreover, research in academic side have been very rare. For these reasons, many researchers have pointed out that basic studies related to e-business in port-logistics industries are needed, and that various practical policies based on results of those basic studies should be discussed. \\nThe aim of this study is to identify e-business types within port-logistics industrial structure, focused on business class and concept of market-space theory. For this, a framework for taxonomy is suggested, and then, through this framework, business types in port-logistics industries are classified. Finally, some implications from the classification are presented."}]},"fpage":"51","lpage":"74","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..45.008","citation-count":"1","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000964871","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"45"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120677","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc95\uc758 \ud63c\ud569\uc804\ub7b5\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud55c \ud574\uc6b4 B2B \uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798 \uc6f9 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc6f9 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Web Mining for B2B e-Commerce Web Sites in Maritime Industry Using Hybrid Strategy of Artificial Intelligence Techniques"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Web Mining for B2B e-Commerce Web Sites in Maritime Industry Using Hybrid Strategy of Artificial Intelligence Techniques"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc720\uc131\uc9c4(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc804\uc790\uc0c1\uac70\ub798\uac00 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub418\uba74\uc11c \ud574\uc6b4 \ubd84\uc57c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub3c4 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc678\uc758 \uc120\uc0ac \ubc0f \ubcf5\ud569\uc6b4\uc1a1\uc5c5\uccb4\ub4e4\uc774 e-\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4 \ub124\ud2b8\uc6cc\ud06c \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uc81c\uace0\uc5d0 \ud798\uc4f0\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc120\ub3c4 \uae30\uc5c5\ub4e4\uc740 \uc6f9 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub97c e-\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uacf5\uac04\uc73c\ub85c \uc778\uc2dd\ud558\uace0 \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \ucee8\ud150\uce20\uc640 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4\ub97c \uc81c\uacf5\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc9c0\ub9cc \uc774\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ub97c \ud1b5\ud55c \uace0\uac1d\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uace0\ub3c4\ud654 \ubc0f \uacbd\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\ud654\ub97c \ucd94\uc9c4\ud558\ub294 \ub2e8\uacc4\uc5d0\ub294 \uc544\uc9c1 \ubbf8\uce58\uc9c0 \ubabb\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \uc6f9 \uc0ac\uc774\ud2b8\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \ubc1c\uc0dd\ud558\ub294 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc640 \uae30\uc5c5\uc758 \ub370\uc774\ud130\ubca0\uc774\uc2a4\ub97c \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc6f9 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\ub294 \ubc29\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uc600\ub2e4.\uc6f9 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd\uc740 \uc778\ud130\ub137 \ud658\uacbd \ud558\uc5d0\uc11c \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\ub294 \ub300\ub7c9\uc758 \uc6f9 \ub370\uc774\ud130\uc5d0 \ub300\ud574 \ub370\uc774\ud130 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \uae30\ubc95\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc720\uc6a9\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ud574 \uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \uc815\ubcf4\ub97c \ucd94\ucd9c\ud574\ub0b4\ub294 \uacfc\uc815\uc744 \uc758\ubbf8\ud558\ub294\ub370, \uc131\uacf5\uc801\uc778 e-\ube44\uc988\ub2c8\uc2a4\uc804\uac1c\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \uae30\uc220\uc774\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc778\uacf5\uc9c0\ub2a5 \uae30\ubc95\uc5d0 \uae30\ubc18\ud55c \uc6f9 \ub9c8\uc774\ub2dd \uae30\uc220\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec e-Business\uc0c1\uc758 \uc628\ub77c\uc778 \uace0\uac1d\uc758 \ud2b9\uc131\uc744 \ubd84\uc11d\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc790\ub8cc\uac00\uc2dc\ud654\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uacfc \uad6c\ub9e4 \ud310\ub9e4 \uc608\uce21\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud6a8\uacfc\uc801\uc778 \uad6c\uc870\uc640 \ud575\uc2ec\uc801\uc778 \ubd84\uc11d\uc808\ucc28\ub97c \uc81c\uc548\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"As B2B EC is boosted shipping lines and composite transportation companies have a great effort on increasing competitiveness through building e-business networks.

customer satisfaction management are essentially required as the key strategies for development of a corporate. Nowadays, due to the increasing importance of a company\'s responsibilities on environmental safety, international standards related to safety and environment are widely adopted. Thus, all the organizations of a corporate monitor the effects of their activities, products, and services on environment and reflect this their environment policies. By doing so, they collect their major ability to obtain and prove environment achievement. This is because the environment laws are becoming strict and economic or other means that stimulate the protection of environment are developing and the persons concerned are getting more interested in environmental problems and sustainable growth.Therefore, the shipping companies have to basically consider the following summarized issues of this research;First, they have to establish the consistency of the organization\'s goals and internal environment by setting up clear management objectives. Particularly shipping companies have to present sustainable environment safety policies.\\nSecond, they need to collectively manage the organization of controlling vessels\' environment safety and its activities understanding that 80% of marine accidents are caused by human mistakes.Third, as the management process of environment safe activities is conducted based on the professional theories such

objective of this study is to analyze the difference between foreign and domestic firms for the problems in structure of logistics professionals, performance ability, and education. The difference of these problems are also analyzed for the general logistics companies that are newly formed during 1990s. The focus is on general logistics companies in Korea that provide logistics services. This study developed detail evaluation items for logistics professionals\' performance ability. It is based on previous studies, verification of feasibility, and justification of the logistics professionals\' structure by their specialization. General logistics labor forces are classified by their fields and specific subjects of logistics professionals are presented conceptually. The comparative analysis of interest level is also performed for 13 education items. The education items are derived from the questions and the answers which they feel the most needed education items at present for the professionals at general logistics companies. The main objective of this study is to find the notable difference between foreign- owned and domestically-owned general logistics companies for the three problems in the above. Superior logistics service by foreign-owned logistics companies are presupposed for the basic condition in the analysis. We found that the level of specialization and the evaluation of performance ability of logistics professionals in foreign-owned logistic companies are higher compare to domestic companies. They continuously increase their level of specialist in the organization, and their professionals\' performance ability is more advanced than domestic companies"}]},"fpage":"93","lpage":"118","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..44.003","citation-count":"10","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120607","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"44"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000950716","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158\uacfc \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \uc120\uc11d \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc57c\ub4dc \uc124\uacc4\uc758 \ud1b5\ud569"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Integration of Ship Planning and Yard Layout using Simulation and Genetic Algorithms"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Integration of Ship Planning and Yard Layout using Simulation and Genetic Algorithms"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ud64d\ub3d9\ud76c(\uacbd\uae30\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc790\uc6d0 \ud560\ub2f9\uacfc \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uad6c\uc870\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc804\ub7b5\uc801 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \ud558\ub294\ub370 \uc788\uc5b4 \uc6b0\uc120 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ub2e8\uacc4\ub85c\ub294 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc758 \ubc30\uce58\ub97c \ucd5c\uc801\ud654\ud558\uace0 \uacc4\ud68d\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud55c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ub3c4\uad6c\ub97c \uc815\uc758\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ub97c \uc5b4\ub514\uc5d0 \uc7a5\uce58\ud560 \uac83\uc778\uac00\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uacb0\uc815\uc5d0\ub294 \ub9ce\uc740 \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774 \uc801\uc6a9\ub418\ub294\ub370, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uac00 \uc7a5\uce58\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \ud604\uc7ac\uc758 \uc0c1\ud0dc, \ucd5c\uc885 \ubaa9\uc801\uc9c0, \uc120\ubc15\uc758 \uc811\uc548 \uc704\uce58, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\uc758 \ud06c\uae30\uc640 \uc885\ub958 \ub4f1\uc774 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\uc5d0 \ud574\ub2f9\ub41c\ub2e4. \ubb38\uc81c\ub294 \uc774\ub7ec\ud55c \ubcc0\uc218\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0c1\ud638 \uacbd\uc7c1\uc801\uc774\uba70, \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ub4e4\uc774 \uc120\ubc15 \ub3c4\ucc29 \uba87 \uc8fc\uc804\uc5d0\uc57c \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc5d0 \ub3c4\ucc29\ud55c\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc774 \ub17c\ubb38\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130(\ud639\uc740 \uc2a4\ucf00\uc904\ub9c1)\uc758 \uc0dd\uc131 \uacc4\ud68d\uacfc \uc57c\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c\uc758 \ud074\ub7ec\uc2a4\ud130\uc758 \ucd5c\uc801 \uc704\uce58 \uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \uc720\uc804\uc790 \uc54c\uace0\ub9ac\uc998\uc744 \uc801\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \uc2e4\uc81c \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc5d0\uc11c \uc2dc\ubbac\ub808\uc774\uc158 \ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \ud1b5\ud574 \uadf8 \uacb0\uacfc\ub97c \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uace0\uc790 \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The goal of this research is to develop software tools to be integrated into the present software application environment to support terminal operators, in making strategic decisions about resource allocation and terminal structure. The major important step in this process is to define a simulation tool, in order to plan and optimize the placement of containers in the terminal. Many parameters are applied to the decision about where a container is to be placed in the terminal yard: the present occupancy level of the container area, the final destination of the containers, the best position to dock the ship, and the container\'s size and its type, etc. The problems is that these parameters are competitive, and the containers arrive some weeks before the ship\'s actual arrival date. Thus, this paper implements genetic algorithms(GAs) for the cluster(or scheduling) creation plan and the decision of optimal location of the cluster in the yard, and suggests the result by simulation model in the current terminal."}]},"fpage":"77","lpage":"92","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..44.010","citation-count":"4","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000950716","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"44"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120541","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc801\uc815 \ub2a5\ub825\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ube44\uad50 \ubd84\uc11d"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Standard Capacity of Container Terminal"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Empirical Study on the Standard Capacity of Container Terminal"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uae40\ucc3d\uace4(\uc21c\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc7a5\uc131\uc6a9(\uc11c\uc6b8\uacfc\ud559\uae30\uc220\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uc120\uc11d\ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc57c\ub4dc\ub2a5\ub825\uc73c\ub85c \uad6c\uc131\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc120\uc11d\uacfc \uc57c\ub4dc\ub294 \uc0c1\ud638 \uc758\uc874\uc801\uc778 \uad00\uacc4\uc5d0\uc11c \uc791\uc5c5\uc774 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc9c0\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0, \uc120\uc11d\ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc57c\ub4dc\ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ub2a5\ub825\uc744 \ud5a5\uc0c1\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ud574\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4. \uc120\ubc15\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc774 \ub192\uc544\uc9c8\uc218\ub85d \uc120\uc11d\uc810\uc720\uc728\uc740 \ub0ae\uc544\uc9c0\uace0 \uc120\uc11d\ub2a5\ub825\ub3c4 \ub0ae\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub610\ud55c \uc57c\ub4dc\uc5d0\uc11c \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108 \uc7a5\uce58\uae30\uac04\uc774 \uae38\uc5b4\uc9c0\uba74 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc740 \ub192\uc544\uc9c0\uace0, \uc57c\ub4dc\ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \ub0ae\uac8c \ud3c9\uac00\ub41c\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \ub2a5\ub825\uc740 \uace0\uac1d\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc801\uc815 \uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \uc720\uc9c0\ud558\uba74\uc11c \ucc98\ub9ac\uac00\ub2a5\ud55c \ubb3c\ub3d9\ub7c9\uc744 \uae30\uc900\uc73c\ub85c \ud3c9\uac00\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud558\uba70, \uc774\ub54c \uc120\uc11d\ub2a5\ub825\uacfc \uc57c\ub4dc\ub2a5\ub825\uc774 \uade0\ud615\uc744 \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc57c \ud55c\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The capacity of a container terminal is composed of berth and yard capacity, which depend on each other.

It is also remembered that the success of the industrial park is associated with the efficient logistics management of the firms in Kasong Area. It is imperative that we learn a lesson from past failures to develop the industrial park in Najin and Sunbong."}]},"fpage":"17","lpage":"40","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2005..44.005","citation-count":"10","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120539","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2005","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"44"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000950692","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ub300\ub7c9\ud654\ubb3c\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uac70\ub798\uad00\uacc4 \uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc120\ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \uacf5\uc0dd\uad00\uacc4"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The symbiotic relationship between carriers and shippers in Japan"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The symbiotic relationship between carriers and shippers in Japan"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\ud55c\uc885\uae38(\uc131\uacb0\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \ub17c\ubb38\uc740 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc758 \ub300\ub7c9\ud654\ubb3c \uc218\uc1a1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uac70\ub798\uad00\uacc4\uad6c\ucd95\uc744 \ud1b5\ud55c \uc120\ud654\uc8fc\uc758 \uacf5\uc0dd\uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ucd08\uc810\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub97c \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \uba3c\uc800 \uc77c\ubcf8 \ub300\ub7c9\ud654\ubb3c \uc218\uc1a1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc2e4\ud0dc\uc640 \uadf8 \uc0ac\uc801 \uc9c4\ud589\uacfc\uc815\uc5d0 \ub300\ud558\uc5ec \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub450 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub85c\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\ud574\uc6b4\uc758 \uac70\ub798\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \ud2b9\uc9d5\ud558\ub294 \ucee4\ubbf8\uc158 \uce90\ub9ac\uc5b4\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \ub17c\ud558\uace0 \uc774\ub97c \ud1b5\ud558\uc5ec \uc77c\ubcf8 \uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc774 \uacc4\uc5f4\uacfc \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uac70\ub798\uad00\uacc4\uc5d0 \ubc14\ud0d5\uc744 \ub450\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uaddc\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc138 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub85c\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc120\uc0ac\uc640 \ub300\ub7c9\ud654\uc8fc\uac04\uc758 \ud611\ub825\uad00\uacc4\uc758 \uad6c\uc870\ub97c \uc870\uc120\uc5c5\uc744 \ud3ec\ud568\ud55c \uc0bc\uac01\uad6c\ub3c4\ub85c \uc124\uba85\ud55c\ub2e4. \ub124 \ubc88\uc9f8\ub85c\ub294 \uc77c\ubcf8\ud574\uc6b4\uacfc \ud654\uc8fc \ubc0f \uad00\ub828 \uc5c5\uacc4\uc0ac\uc774\uc758 \uc7a5\uae30\uc801 \uac70\ub798\uad00\uacc4\uad6c\ucd95\uc758 \ubc30\uacbd\uc5d0\ub294 \uc815\ucc45\uacb0\uc815\uae30\uad00\uc778 \uc77c\ubcf8\uc815\ubd80\uc640 \uc77c\ubcf8\uac1c\ubc1c\uc740\ud589 \ub4f1 \uad6d\ucc45\uae08\uc735\uae30\uad00\uc774 \ubcf5\ud569\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uacb0\ud569\ub41c \uad6c\ub3c4\ub97c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0b4\ub294 \ud638\ud61c\uc758 \uc11c\ud074\uc774 \uc874\uc7ac\ud558\uace0 \uc788\uc74c\uc744 \uc5d8\uc5d4\uc9c0\uc218\uc1a1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc0ac\ub840\ub97c \ub4e4\uc5b4 \uc124\uba85\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9, \uacb0\ub860\uc73c\ub85c \ucd5c\uadfc \uc77c\ubcf8\uc120\uc0ac\ub4e4\uc774 \uc0bc\uad6d\uac04 \uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc9c4\ucd9c\uc5d0 \uacf5\uaca9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\uc11c\uace0 \uc788\ub294 \uc774\uc720\ub85c \uc77c\ubcf8\uc120\uc0ac\uc758 \uac70\ub798\ube44\uc6a9\uc6b0\uc704\uc5d0 \ub530\ub978 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc2dc\uc7a5 \uc720\ubcf4\uc640 \uad6d\ub0b4\uc218\uc1a1\uc2dc\uc7a5\uc758 \uc0c1\ub300\uc801 \uaddc\ubaa8\ucd95\uc18c\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \ub300\uc751\uc774\ub77c\ub294 \uc810\uc744 \uba85\ud655\ud788 \ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This Paper focused on the symbiotic relationship that based on long term transport contract for big volume cargoes such as iron ore, crude oil, LNG, and coal, between carrier and shipper in Japan.

This study applies Aggregated Performance Index to provide an efficiency measurement for international ports. The Aggregated Performance Index technique is powerful in resolving the measurement of port efficiency and ranking of port, because Aggregated Performance Index has been applied to analyze the relative efficiency of decision-making units (DMUs) in a set of multiple inputs and multiple outputs, and don\'t require an explicit a priori determination of relationships between outputs and inputs. Using multidimensional scaling (MDS) process, we adjustment and present an alternative that is theoretically and practically superior to the most common methods proposed in the past papers, especially in the DMUs measure field. This method overcomes the problem of Data Envelopment Analysis method which can neither rank efficiency of ports nor show the real efficiency distance of DMUs. Thus, the Aggregated Performance Index method is useful in wide array of Australian and other international ports\' ranking.Finally this Aggregated Performance Index method is applied to the ranking of 16 international ports. As a result, five ports, the port of Melbourne, the port of Osaka, the port of Zeebrugge, the port of Brisbane, and the port of Fremantle are found to be the most inefficient ports.

In this aspect, the main purpose of this study lies in surveying and analysing the development and status of North China\'s ports including Shanghai where direct calling is taking place, considering the spreading effects on Korea\'s ports, and drawing up a plan for improving Korea\'s port competitiveness. \\nThe research scope is to cover the subjective ports of Korea and China\'s 7 major ports (Busan, Gwangyang, Sanghai, Qingdao, Tienjin, Dalian and Kaoshuing). The substance of this study contains the extraction of port competitiveness components through the previous existing studies and the pilot test and factor analysis which reflect the opinions of working-level personnel and researchers related to the subjective ports. The evaluation structure of port competitiveness is established by utilizing the results of factor analysis. Then, we extract the relevant port competitiveness using MDMG-HFP (Multi Decision Multi Group-Hierarchical Fuzzy Process) to execute the competitiveness evaluation of the subjective ports on the basis of the established evaluation structure. Finally, we draw the factors that increase the competitiveness of major ports by applying the IRFE(Inverse Relation of Fuzzy Evaluation), and present Korea\'s strategic planning and implications

As the volume of wine trade increased, the tax tunnage was imposed on the wine barrel. The term ton have been used as the unit of ship\'s size since the 15th century. English people had kept on trying to calculate the tonnage by using 3 components of ship\'s dimension, that is the length, the breath, and the depth. At last tonnage was calculated by the following form; tonnage = ( L x B x D) \xf7 divisor\\nTonnage measurement introduced in 1582 by Baker had been modified with the time and finally George Moorsom invented the concept of gross and net tonnage respectively in 1854. Moorsom\'s Measurement was spreaded to many countries such as USA, France, Netherlands, Germany, Norway, Japan and etc. Many governments used the net tonnage as the basis of taxation. But Moorsom\'s Measurement had defects to measure net tonnage, because it used not real volume but fixed ratio volume to deduct the space of engine room. For example, in case of vessels propelled by paddle-wheels, in which the tonnage of the space occupied by the machinery is above 20 per cent. and under 30 per cent. of the gross tonnage, the deduction shall be 37 per cent. of the gross tonnage. \\nMany shipping countries had proposed to rationalize the tonnage measurement meanwhile. Finally UN adopted International Convention on Tonnage Measurement of Ships in 1969 and it came into effect 1980."}]},"fpage":null,"lpage":null,"orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..43.017","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120476","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"43"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000944770","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\u8a18\u540d\u5f0f \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c\uc758 \u8b93\u6e21\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \u5224\u4f8b\u5206\u6790"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Analysis of the Case for the Transfer of Non-negotiable Straight B/L"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Analysis of the Case for the Transfer of Non-negotiable Straight B/L"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uf9f4\u932b\u73c9(\ud55c\uc2e0\ub300\ud559\uad50 )"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\uc6b0\ub9ac \uc0c1\ubc95\uc740 \uc120\ud558\uc99d\uad8c(B/L)\uc740 \ub2f9\uc5f0\ud55c \uc9c0\uc2dc\uc99d\uad8c\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \u8b93\u6e21\u53ef\u80fd\ud55c \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ud574\uc11d\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \u672c\u4ef6\uc758 \u722d\u9ede\uc740 \uc720\ud1b5\ubd88\ub2a5 \uae30\uba85\uc2dd B/L\uc744 \uc18c\uc9c0\ud55c \uc2e0\uc6a9\uc7a5 \uac1c\uc124\uc740\ud589\uc778 \uc911\uc18c\uae30\uc5c5\uc740\ud589\uc774 B/L\uc758 \uc815\ub2f9\ud55c \u6240\u6301\u4eba\uc73c\ub85c\uc11c \u8ca8\u7269\u5f15\u6e21\u8acb\u6c42\u6b0a\uc744 \uac16\ub294\uc9c0\uc758 \uc5ec\ubd80\uc774\ub2e4. \ubc95\uc6d0\uc740 \uc720\ud1b5\ubd88\ub2a5 \uae30\uba85\uc2dd B/L\uc758 \u8ca8\u7269\u5f15\u6e21\u8acb\u6c42\u6b0a\u8005\ub294 \u53d7\u8377\u4eba\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc7ac\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \u8005\uc774\uba70, \uc218\ud558\uc778\uc73c\ub85c \uae30\uc7ac\ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uc790\ub294, \ube44\ub85d \uadf8\uac00 B/L \uc6d0\ubcf8\uc744 \u6240\u6301\ud558\uace0 \uc788\ub354\ub77c\ub3c4 \ud654\ubb3c\uc778\ub3c4\uccad\uad6c\uad8c\uc774 \uc5c6\ub2e4\uace0 \ud310\uacb0\ud588\ub2e4. \ub530\ub77c\uc11c \uc740\ud589\uc740 \uc720\ud1b5\ubd88\ub2a5 \uae30\uba85\uc2dd B/L \ubc1c\ud589\uc870\uac74\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6a9\uc7a5\uc744 \uac1c\uc124\ud560 \ub54c\ub294, \uc218\uc785\uc0c1\uc758 \uc2e0\uc6a9\uc0c1\ud0dc\ub97c \uc5c4\uaca9\ud788 \uc810\uac80\ud574\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The carrier is undoubtedly contractually bound to deliver the goods to the consignee named in a non-negotiable straight bill of lading.

Nevertheless, there are no serious efforts to curb piracy due to territorial sovereignty of each country, restrictions against hot pursuit, jurisdictional problems and lack of superpower to conduct the joint patrol of the high seas and international shipping lanes. \\nKorean government has been very active in an effort to combat piracy and played a major role to construct a framework for regional common efforts.

Measures for regional cooperation on future anti-piracy are also essential because the piracy attack has the potential to negatively affect the regional economic prosperity."}]},"fpage":null,"lpage":null,"orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..43.007","citation-count":"28","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120417","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"43"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120475","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"1763\u5e74 \u5c0d\u65e5\u901a\u4fe1\u4f7f\u8239\uc758 \u5efa\u9020"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"Building of Envoy Ships\' - Voyaging to Japan in 1763"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Building of Envoy Ships\' - Voyaging to Japan in 1763"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uae40\uc7ac\uc2b9(\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc591\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":{"@lang":"original"}},"fpage":null,"lpage":null,"orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..43.024","citation-count":"2","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120475","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"43"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000944548","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"A STUDY ON COOPERATION MODEL FOR PORTS IN THE NORTHEAST ASIA"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"A STUDY ON COOPERATION MODEL FOR PORTS IN THE NORTHEAST ASIA"}]},"author-group":{"author":"HyungRimChoi()"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \ub3d9\ubd81\uc544 \uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0\uc11c \ud070 \ube44\uc911\uc744 \ucc28\uc9c0\ud558\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc774 \uc11c\ub85c \ud611\ub825\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \uc0c8\ub85c\uc6b4 \ubaa8\ub378, PLCM(Port-Logistics Chain Management)\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud55c\ub2e4.

The SDM is essentially based on a checklist which concentrates on the status of the port\'s environmental management. The main objective is to review management activities and procedures with regard to the environment, and the way that the port authority currently deals with its significant environmental aspects. The results should comprise a list of points for attention, and can be used to detail the port\'s environmental strategy and to report the results obtained. Therefore, the SDM model can give several benefits to the seaports for improving the environmental management. \\nSurvey of actual condition for environmental management in Korean seaports by using the information in the internet websites showed us that the SDM designed by ESPO(2001), and Darbra et al.(2003) is easily applicable to the Korean seaports also. Korean seaports have shown the weakness in terms of items about resources and budget, responsibility for the environmental problems, external communication, manuals, emergency case, monitoring, and auditing. Therefore, the policy making for introduction of SDM by The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries should follow immediately."}]},"fpage":null,"lpage":null,"orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..43.026","citation-count":"14","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120474","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"43"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000944576","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"The Motivation for Port Co-opetition: Strategic Implications to Korea"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Motivation for Port Co-opetition: Strategic Implications to Korea"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Motivation for Port Co-opetition: Strategic Implications to Korea"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc1a1\ub3d9\uc6b1( University of Hong Kong",")"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Globalisation and borderless businesses become a major impetus for ports to compete against their neighbouring ports serving the more-or-less same customers and hinterlands. To obtain and sustain their relative power within the region, the ports have traditionally opted for a competitive (\'destructive\') strategy, which results in a win-lose situation. An alternative was suggested; that is, a win-win game could be achieved by the concept of co-opetition: a mixed term of competition and cooperation. This concept seems to be new to the port industry.

A warranty may be express or implied. An express warranty is the one which is contained in the policy or in a document referred to by the policy, and is a condition which overrides anything in the policy with which it is inconsistent. An implied warranty does not appear in the policy. It is a warranty which is understood by law to exist in the contract without being expressly stated. \\nWhether or not it is material to the risk, the assured must comply exactly with the terms of the warranty. The warranty must be taken literally and if the assured fails to comply exactly with the warranty, there is said to be a breach of warranty. In the event of a breach of warranty, the insurer is discharged from liability as from the date of the breach. As a result of this study. a few reasons to modify the strict fulfillment of a warranty would be suggested, these are : (1) the unfairness of the responsibility and liability between an insurer and an insured, (2) the inconsistency of the principle of indemnity under the proximate cause, (3) the poor identification of a warranty itself and a breach of a warranty. It is my conclusion that in the present time, the insurance warranty would be complied with not strictly or literally but with flexibility, and the limitation of an insurer\'s right of the breach of a warranty."}]},"fpage":null,"lpage":null,"orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..43.004","citation-count":"10","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000944857","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"06","volume":null,"issue":"43"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120414","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"QFD\ubaa8\ub378\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ubb3c\ub958\uac1c\uc120\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \uad6c\ucd95 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"An Establishment and Evaluation System of Improving Urban Logistics Using QFD Model"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"An Establishment and Evaluation System of Improving Urban Logistics Using QFD Model"}]},"author-group":{"author":"\uc5ec\uae30\ud0dc(\uc778\ucc9c\ub300\ud559\uad50)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ube44\ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ubb3c\ub958\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc740 \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \uc0b0\uc5c5\ud65c\ub3d9 \uc800\ud558, \ubb3c\ub958\ube44 \uc0c1\uc2b9 \ub4f1\uc744 \ucd08\ub798\ud558\uc5ec \uacb0\uacfc\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ub3c4\uc2dc\uc758 \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825\uc744 \uc57d\ud654\uc2dc\ud0ac \uc218 \uc788\ub2e4. \uc774\ub7f0 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \ud6a8\uc728\uc801\uc778 \ub3c4\uc2dc\ubb3c\ub958\uc758 \uc720\uc9c0\xb7\uac1c\uc120 \ubc0f \ud3c9\uac00\ub97c \uc704\ud55c \ub3c4\uc2dc\ubb3c\ub958 \uac1c\uc120\ud3c9\uac00\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uc758 \ud544\uc694\uc131\uc774 \uc99d\ub300\ub418\uace0 \uc788\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc778\ucc9c\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc\ub97c \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc5ec \ud604\uc7ac, 2006\ub144, 2011\ub144\uc758 \ub3c4\uc2dc\ubb3c\ub958 \uc218\uc900\uc744 \ud3c9\uac00\ud558\uace0 \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4\ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc5ec \ub3c4\uc2dc\ubb3c\ub958 \uac1c\uc120\uc548\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\ub294 \uac83\uc744 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubaa9\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \ubc29\ubc95\uc740 \ud56d\ubaa9\uc758 \uc911\uc694\ub3c4 \uce21\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec AHP(Analytic Hierarchy Process)\ubc95\uc744 \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uba70, \ud56d\ubaa9\uac04 \uc0c1\uad00\uad00\uacc4\ub97c \uce21\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud558\uc5ec \ud37c\uc9c0\uc885\uc18d\uad00\uacc4(FSR : Fuzzy Subordination Relations)\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \ub9c8\uc9c0\ub9c9\uc73c\ub85c \ub450 \ub2e8\uacc4\ub97c \ubaa8\ub450 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \uc885\ud569\uc801\uc778 \ubaa8\ub378\ub9c1\ubc95\uc778 QFD(Quality Function Deployment)\ubaa8\ud615\uc744 \ub3c4\uc785\ud558\uc5ec \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ud3c9\uac00 \ubc0f \ubbfc\uac10\ub3c4 \ubd84\uc11d\uc744 \uc218\ud589\ud558\uc600\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Urban Logistics can be defined as any physical distribution that is attained in cities or their vicinities in logistics activities.

However, they failed to accurately predict the change because they employed only limited number of variables which are observable. Unobservable variables, which have been overlooked so far, are likely to affect the demand for shipbuilding considerably. This paper, hence, investigated whether exchange rate volatility affects shipbuilding orders. The GARCH model as well as asymmetric or leverage volatility models, where good news and bad news have different impact on volatility, was introduced in this paper. Namely, such models as EGARCH, AGARCH, and GJR are examined in this paper. The empirical results showed that the GARCH model was the best at capturing the exchange rate volatility.

Moller applied for a declaration that they were entitled to cancel the C/P under the Clause 33. Honam contended that Moller were not entitled cancel the C/P and had repudiated it. Moller\'s cancellation of the C/P was a bitter pill for Honam to swallow. Moller\'s abrupt cancellation when the vessel was several thousand miles from the Gulf had all the appearance of an act of commercial real politik, dictated by the market rather than by any apprehension of the hostilities physically or commercially affecting the vessel.

We employ Johansen\'s multivariate cointegration methodology to find cointegrating vector. The cointegration results suggest that our models are stationary. We also show that the capital intensity of shipping industry increased, but the real revenues and value added did not grow as the nominal ones expanded. This paper applies variance decompositions and impulse-response functions to get additional information regarding the responses of the revenue and value added to the shocks in labor and capital. The empirical results indicate that while both revenue and value added respond positively to the shocks and then decay quickly, the capital shocks last longer and greater than the labor shocks do."}]},"fpage":null,"lpage":null,"orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..40.002","citation-count":"6","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000943633","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"40"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120304","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"AHP\uae30\ubc95\uc744 \ud65c\uc6a9\ud55c \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc6b4\uc601\ubaa9\ud45c \uc124\uc815\uc5d0 \uad00\ud55c \uc5f0\uad6c"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Operating Objective of Automated Container Terminal by the AHP Techniques"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Operating Objective of Automated Container Terminal by the AHP Techniques"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\ubc15\ub0a8\uaddc(\ub3d9\uba85\uc815\ubcf4\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\ucd5c\ud615\ub9bc(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50)","\uc774\ucc3d\uc12d(\ub3d9\uc544\ub300\ud559\uad50)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc5d0\uc11c\ub294 \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc758 \uc6b4\uc601\ubaa9\ud45c\ub97c \uac1d\uad00\uc801\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\uc815\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574 AHP \ubc29\ubc95\uc744 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ud558\uc600\uc73c\uba70, \ub2e4\uc591\ud55c \uc8fc\uccb4\ub4e4\uc758 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc694\uad6c\uc0ac\ud56d\uc744 \uc218\uc6a9\ud558\ub294 \ubaa9\ud45c\uacb0\uc815\uc744 \uc704\ud574 \ubbf8\ub798\uc758 \uace0\uac1d, \uc6b4\uc601\uc790 \ubc0f \uc5f0\uad6c\uae30\uad00\uc744 \ub300\uc0c1\uc73c\ub85c \uc124\ubb38\uc870\uc0ac\uac00 \uc2dc\ud589\ub418\uc5c8\ub2e4. \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ucee8\ud14c\uc774\ub108\ud130\ubbf8\ub110 \uc6b4\uc601\uc758 \uc81c1\uacc4\uce35\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ubbf9\uc2a4\ub85c\ub294 \ucd08\uae30\ud22c\uc790\ube44 \uc808\uac10, \uc6b4\uc601\ube44 \uc808\uac10, \uc790\ub3d9\ud654\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \uc131\ub2a5 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uc6b4\uc601\ud6a8\uc728\ud654 \ubc0f \uc0dd\uc0b0\uc131 \ud5a5\uc0c1, \uace0\uac1d\uc11c\ube44\uc2a4 \uc81c\uace0\ub97c \uc120\uc815\ud558\uc600\ub2e4. \uc804\uccb4\uc801 \uad00\uc810\uc5d0\uc11c \uc911\uc694\ud55c \ubaa9\ud45c\uc694\uc778\uc740 2\uacc4\uce35\uc758 \ubaa9\ud45c\ubbf9\uc2a4\uc911 \u2018\uc6b4\uc601\ube44 \uc808\uac10\u2019\uc774\uc5c8\ub2e4. \ubcf8 \uc5f0\uad6c\uc758 \uacb0\uacfc\ub294 \ud5a5\ud6c4 \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uac1c\ubc1c \ubc0f \uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c\uac1c\ubc1c\uc2dc \uace0\ub824\ud574\uc57c \ud558\ub294 \uc911\uc694\ud55c \uc0ac\ud56d\uc778 \uac74\uc124\ud22c\uc790\ube44\uc758 \uc218\uc900, \uc815\ubcf4\uc2dc\uc2a4\ud15c \ubc0f \uc790\ub3d9\ud654 \ud558\uc5ed\uc7a5\ube44\uc758 \ud22c\uc790\ube44 \uc218\uc900, \ubb34\uc778\ud654\uc758 \uc815\ub3c4 \ubc0f \ud130\ubbf8\ub110\uc6b4\uc601 \uc131\uacfc \ub4f1\uc5d0 \ub300\ud55c \uc77c\uc815\ud55c \uac00\uc774\ub4dc\ub77c\uc778\uc744 \uc81c\uc2dc\ud558\uac8c \ub420 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Korea government tries to introduce automated operating system to elevate the management efficiency of the container terminal.

The result of the analysis revealed that most important factor among objectives mix was \u201cthe minimization of operation expense.\u201d Especially, the user group preferred to select the factor of \u201cthe improvement of customer service\u201d as objective rather than select other objectives. The result of this research will suggest some guidelines for deciding the level of investment of terminal construction, information system, automation equipment, terminal worker and etc, which are to be considered in terminal development and the system development hereafter."}]},"fpage":"113","lpage":"130","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2004..40.006","citation-count":"16","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART001120304","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2004","pub-mon":"03","volume":null,"issue":"40"},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART001120303","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"\ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac(BPA)\uc758 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\uc640 \uac1c\uc120\ubc29\uc548"},{"@lang":"foreign","#text":"The Regional Economic Effects of the Establishment of the Busan Port Authority and Improvement Strategies"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The Regional Economic Effects of the Establishment of the Busan Port Authority and Improvement Strategies"}]},"author-group":{"author":["\uc190\uc560\ud718(\ubd80\uc0b0\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc\uccad)","\uc6d0\ud76c\uc5f0(\ubd80\uc0b0\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc)"]},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"BPA\uc758 \ud22c\uc790\uc7ac\uc6d0\uc744 \ucd94\uc815\ud558\uace0 \ubd80\uc0b0 \uc9c0\uc5ed\uc0b0\uc5c5\uc5f0\uad00\ud45c\ub97c \uc774\uc6a9\ud558\uc5ec \uc9c0\uc5ed\uacbd\uc81c\uc5d0 \ubbf8\uce58\ub294 \ud30c\uae09\ud6a8\uacfc\ub97c \ub3c4\ucd9c\ud558\uc600\uc73c\ub098 \uae30\ub300\ub9cc\ud07c \ud06c\uc9c0 \uc54a\uc740 \uac83\uc73c\ub85c \ub098\ud0c0\ub0ac\ub2e4. \uc774\ub294 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac\ubc95\ub839\uc5d0\uc11c PA\uc758 \uad00\ub9ac\ubc94\uc704\ub97c \ud55c\uacc4\uc9c0\uc5b4 \ub193\uc544 \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d\uc5d0\uc11c \uc77c\uc5b4\ub09c \u6536\u5165\uc774 \uc911\uc559\uc815\ubd80\ub85c 30% \uc774\uc0c1 \uadc0\uc18d\ub418\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc774\ub2e4. \\n\uc774\ub97c \uac1c\uc120\ud558\uae30 \uc704\ud574\uc11c\ub294 PA\uc758 \uc7ac\uc815, \uc778\uc0ac, \uc0ac\uc5c5 \ub4f1 \uc804\ubc18\uc5d0 \uac78\uccd0 \uc911\uc559\uc815\ubd80\uac00 \ud1b5\uc81c\ud558\ub3c4\ub85d \ub418\uc5b4 \uc788\ub294 \ud604 \ud56d\ub9cc\uacf5\uc0ac\ubc95\ub839\uc774, PA\uac00 \uc911\uc559\uc815\ubd80\ub85c\ubd80\ud130 \uc804\uad8c\uc744 \uc704\uc784\ubc1b\uc544 \ud56d\ub9cc\uc790\uce58\ub97c \uc2e4\ud604\ud560 \uc218 \uc788\ub294 \ubc29\ud5a5\uc73c\ub85c \uac1c\uc815\ub418\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4. \uadf8\uc678 \ubd80\uc0b0\uc2dc\uc758 \ud56d\ub9cc\ubb3c\ub958 \uc911\uc2ec \uc870\uc9c1 \uac1c\ud3b8\uacfc BPA\uc640 \ubd80\uc0b0\uad11\uc5ed\uc2dc\uc758 \uacf5\ub3d9\uc0ac\uc5c5 \uac1c\ubc1c \ub4f1 \uacf5\uc870\uccb4\uc81c\ub97c \uad6c\ucd95\ud558\uc5ec \ubd80\uc0b0\ud56d \uacbd\uc7c1\ub825 \uac15\ud654\uc640 BPA \uc6b4\uc601 \ud65c\uc131\ud654\ub97c \uc774\ub8e8\uc5b4\uc57c \ud560 \uac83\uc774\ub2e4."},{"@lang":"english","#text":"This study estimates the optimal amount of investment required for BPA and analyses its effects on Busan regional economy.

The restrictions imposed by advanced countries are: barriers to enter into the industry, international cartels, alliances, conferences, restrictions on maritime labour movements and stiff shipping registration conditions. As a reaction, developing countries try to find a way to survive in maritime transport service market through: cargo reservation systems using bilateral agreements, Code of Conduct, subsidization of maritime transport sectors and restriction of the commercial presence in ports. It is worth mentioning that developed countries apply the same restriction practices used by developing countries; it is also noticed that liberalizing transport services negotiations neglect the restrictive practices imposed by developing countries whereas they concentrate on the restriction practices used by developing countries. This paper aims at discussing the restrictive practices imposed by both developed and developing countries to liberalize maritime transport services on a fair basis."}]},"fpage":"207","lpage":"228","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2003.39..012","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000916329","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2003","pub-mon":"12","volume":"39","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000916328","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Network Effects of Alliances in International Transportation"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"Network Effects of Alliances in International Transportation"}]},"author-group":{"author":"YOSHIDAShigeru(kobe university)"},"abstract-group":{"abstract":[{"@lang":"original"},{"@lang":"english","#text":"The aim of this study is to analyze the difference of network effects by alliance formation in international liner shipping and airline industries. First of all, the network economy by the alliances is placed in order from the viewpoint of economy of scale. After observing the changes of network service attributes by the alliance formation, the network effects are empirically analyzed on demand and supply sides. We conclude as follows. As it is very difficult for each airline to design freely the route structure to demonstrate the effect of aircraft size, the route of pursuing high frequent service to fulfill customer satisfactions is taken. For liner shipping, as well as for airlines, customers are acquired by increasing the number of service points and frequencies. However, an important variable of demand functions for liner shipping is average cost or average ship size, and the influences of service points and frequencies are relatively small."}]},"fpage":"187","lpage":"205","orte-open-yn":"Y","doi":null,"uci":"G704-000463.2003.39..005","citation-count":"0","url":"https://www.kci.go.kr/kciportal/ci/sereArticleSearch/ciSereArtiView.kci?sereArticleSearchBean.artiId=ART000916328","verified":"N"}},{"journalInfo":{"journal-name":"\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\uc5f0\uad6c","publisher-name":"\ud55c\uad6d\ud574\uc6b4\ubb3c\ub958\ud559\ud68c","foreign-listed":null,"pub-year":"2003","pub-mon":"12","volume":"39","issue":null},"articleInfo":{"@article-id":"ART000989938","article-categories":"\ud574\uc0c1\uc6b4\uc1a1\ud559","article-regularity":"Y","title-group":{"article-title":[{"@lang":"original","#text":"Location-Allocation

Customers have usually expected the improvement of the quality of service they receive, so providers are struggling to meet these expectations.\\nThis study aims at providing service managers with a basis of their decisions for service improvement, measuring service qualities of international ferry companies and analyzing the measurements with the SERVQUAL-QFD model for service quality measurements.\\nIn this study, the service quality is measured on the basis of the service quality evaluation (SERVQUAL) model concept. The necessary data were gathered from international ferry passengers(Busan, Korea - Japan) by the use of questionnaire.\\nThe results analyed by principal component regression are represented on the
